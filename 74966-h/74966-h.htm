<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTORY">INTRODUCTORY</h2>
</div>


<p>In presenting this work to the army of candy
makers of America, I give them the benefit of my
twenty years’ experience. I make no great pretensions
and deny that I am the only candy maker
on earth, but think the fruit of my twenty years’
experience, expressed in this little volume, will be
a benefit to any one who may have the fortune or
misfortune to possess it.</p>

<p>The aim of the author is to present this work
in plain common-sense language, so that the average
candy maker can readily digest its contents.
I modestly lay claim to having published in this
volume the largest number of creditable recipes
for making candy ever presented in a single work.
Also, that it is positively the only candy book
strictly up to date that can be of any service to
the retailer.</p>

<p>In issuing this new and revised edition, I have
indexed the recipes, added new ones, noted improvements
in the way of handling old ones, and
given a few hints on window decorations.</p>

<p>Since issuing the first edition of this book, in
1897, new ideas have been brought out and new
varieties introduced; and it is the intention of the
author to keep this work fully up to date.</p>

<p>Wishing my patrons unlimited success in the
use of my book, I am,</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">Yours respectfully,</span><br>
W. O. Rigby.<br>

<hr class="brk"><h3>CLEANLINESS A NECESSARY FEATURE.</h3>

<p>Of all places, a candy shop should be a model
of cleanliness. Make this a strict rule and always
adhere to it.</p>

<p>Visitors often inspect your kitchen, and of
course form opinions. These opinions cannot be
creditable to any extent if your place is not neat
and tidy. The opinions visitors form on such
tours of inspection will do much to build up your
trade or tear down your patronage, and make you
a reputation. In my mind it is the most essential
step toward a successful candymaking business.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid that your helper will learn
candymaking; a good helper—one that takes an
interest in his work—will more than repay you for
the trouble in teaching him, in the additional help
you get out of him.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>PLAIN TALK TO THE EMPLOYE.</h3>

<p>Success in any business is rarely ever obtained
by any man who lacks sobriety. The candy maker
is no exception to this rule, as all our formulas
are carried in our heads, after we become proficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
in the business, and a close-thinking brain is indispensable.
Wages are decided by worth. If
the man who preceded you in your present position
received twelve or fifteen dollars a week, is
that any reason you should receive the same
amount? You may not be worth twelve dollars,
and you may make yourself worth more. Strict
attention to business, making your employer’s interests
your own, working a little overtime if necessary,
all increase your worth to your employer,
and he will not be slow to recognize it in a substantial
manner.</p>

<p>The oldest candy maker is not always the best
candy maker, and is not always worth the greatest
wages. The young man of ability, integrity,
honesty and hustling qualities is the winner.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>WINDOW DECORATIONS.</h3>

<p>One thing I wish to impress upon the mind of
every reader of this book; that is, too much attention
cannot be given to your display window.
I consider this one-half the store. A neat and
tasty display will attract people to your window,
and nine times out of ten they will see something
to tempt their appetites.</p>

<p>Keep your window clean and well lighted;
change the display in them every other day; keep
neat, tasty signs on your goods; introduce new
and novel features.</p>

<p>I will give you a few ideas on window decorations:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span></p>


<h4>DISPLAY NO. 1.</h4>

<p>Cover the bottom of your window with clean
paper; then empty a barrel of granulated sugar in
the window; make a pile in center, and four small
piles, one on each corner; place on the center pile
three cakes of sweet or bitter chocolate. Now
place on a white china plate a pile of chocolate
creams, one for each corner pile, and now run a
row of chocolate creams from each corner pile to
the center pile. Then place a sign on this display
as follows:</p>

<p>Individual display is always a good way to dispose
of any particular article you wish to push. An
entire window trimmed in caramels, chocolates,
hoarhound drops or marshmallows will make them
sell.</p>

<p>During the summer, if your windows are not
closed, think it is a good idea not to trim them,
as the goods get dirty, and covered with flies, giving
one the impression that your goods are all like
the ones displayed in your windows. Better to
keep a few nice plants in your window.</p>

<hr class="brk">
<h3>A WORD TO THE EMPLOYER.</h3>

<p>When your candymaker has exercised his skill
in preparing your confections, see that they are
properly cared for after being placed in the store.
By the carelessness of inexperienced clerks many
candies are ruined and rendered unfit to sell to the
better class of trade.</p>

<p>Bon bons should never be stacked high in the
show case shortly after being made, because they
are soft and will not stand pressure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span></p>

<p>Some clerks, in selling chocolates or candies of
any kind, handle them as if they were lumps of
coal, instead of exercising the greatest care and
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: gentelest" id="gentelest">gentlest</ins> touch. Too great attention cannot be paid
to this feature of the business. A clerk must learn
this, and if after a reasonable time does not, is unfit
for the business and should seek some occupation
where brains are in less demand.</p>

<p>In piling bon bons on your dishes or trays, place
a sheet of heavy wax paper between each layer.
This will prevent them from sticking.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>HOW TO ARRANGE YOUR SHOP.</h3>

<p>Arrange your shop with a view to economy of
time. A man working in a poorly arranged shop
will walk many extra miles during a day’s work.
Place your furnace in a well-lighted place; it will
save gas bills and enable you to always see the condition
of your batch, providing the draft is not cut
off to any extent. Sugar, glucose and water are
used in almost all candies, therefore have them
side by side; you cannot easily move the sink, so
move your sugar, glucose and scales as near it as
possible.</p>

<p>Keep a pail of clean water beside your furnace,
and when not using your paddle place it in the
water; this will prevent the paddle from becoming
sticky and collecting filth, which condition it is
generally in when not cared for in this manner.</p>

<p>Be sure and have your starch room separate
from the rest of your shop, even if you have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
make an enclosure in one corner of your kitchen.
If so, muslin or some other cheap fabric will answer
the purpose. Also leave your candy slab so as
to afford ample room on every side of it. Your
spinning table should be as long as your room can
accommodate, and at least three or three and a
half feet wide. Never allow your flavors and colors
to become mixed on one shelf. Lumber is cheap,
so have lots of shelf room to spare, so when you
start after a certain flavor you will not have to
overhaul your whole stock of bottles to find it.
It might be well to arrange them in alphabetical
order. Have a separate shelf for your raw material,
such as shelled nuts, chocolate, cocoa butter,
paraffin, etc.</p>

<p>In dipping chocolate, provide yourself with oilcloth
covered boards of a convenient size, about
twelve by eighteen inches, as the oilcloth is superior
to wax paper, and cheaper. These boards
should be placed, when filled with chocolates, in a
rack, which should be located in as cool a place as
possible. These boards may be used for bon bons
by covering them with wax paper. Nails are cheap,
so have a nail for everything that is made to hang
up, and see that it hangs there. See that your coal
box is as near the furnace as possible. I would
suggest that the kindling for tomorrow’s fire be
prepared the night before. If possible, have two
candy hooks in the shop, as they can be had for a
song. Your candy thermometer should be placed
in a can of water, which should be directly behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
the stove; this will keep the tube free from gummy
candy, so that the figures can easily be read, and
it will also be more accurate. A small bin, say
three by six feet and twelve inches high, will be
very useful for mixing your candies in in the fall
of the year, and it will cost very little to put it up.
Have it placed in one corner of your room when
not in use for candy. It can be used to advantage
for a great many purposes. Also hang a good,
strong dipper over the glucose barrel, for use, and
do not get into the filthy habit of taking it out
with your hands. By pouring at least two quarts
of cold water into the glucose barrel when first
opened, the glucose will run out so much easier
and will not adhere to the dipper in the least. Also
have a good, strong barrel near your furnace, to
set your kettle on when stirring your batch; you
will avoid an accident, such as tipping while stirring,
and also keep your floor in a good, tidy condition.</p>

<p>If I have failed to mention some things in this
article, exercise your own good judgment, with
the idea of convenience always uppermost in your
mind, and time will tell you of your business foresight
in a substantial manner.</p>

<p>As this book will fall into the hands of some who
have never made candy, I will add the following
points:</p>

<p>First. In making taffies, be sure that your slab
or marble is always clean and well greased. I would
suggest that it be greased with cotton seed oil, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
some reliable slab dressing such as you will find
mentioned in the rear of this book, as it is far better
than lard and never becomes rancid. This of course
is known by all candy makers and will be looked at
lightly by them, as they know all of these points;
but, as I have said before, as this book will fall
in the hands of new beginners, I will endeavor to
place all the information possible before them so
that they will be able to understand just what to
do and avoid mistakes from the start.</p>

<p>Second. In cooking hard candies, such as tablets,
buttercups, ocean waves, stick candy, or in
fact any kind of candy that is cooked over 280°
and is to be pulled on the hook or handled, you
must use while doing so a pair of buckskin gloves
or mittens, as they not only protect the hands but
also give the goods a fine gloss.</p>

<p>I will no doubt use a great many plain words in
all formulas, but it is for the purpose of making all
the points in candy making so plain that a new beginner
will have no trouble to understand just what
to do, and if he will follow out my instructions,
just as I have placed them before him, I am satisfied
that he will become proficient in the art of
candy making in a short time.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>POINTER IN MELTING CHOCOLATE FOR
DIPPING.</h3>

<p>When you prepare chocolate for dipping, and
should you find out that you have no cocoa butter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
in stock <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: fo" id="fo">for</ins> thinning it, add a little Nucoa butter. It
will answer the purpose and is equal to cocoa butter,
and also cheaper.</p>

<p>By mixing equal parts of bitter and sweet chocolate
you will have a better colored and better eating
chocolate than by using only sweet chocolate.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>NOTICE.</h3>

<p>Whenever you cook a batch of candy that contains
cream and is to be pulled upon the hook,
see that the batch is one-half glucose and one-half
sugar, as cream in a pulled batch has a tendency
to grain in a short time. Therefore, remember
this and avoid grained batches.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>A POINTER ON DIPPING BON BONS.</h3>

<p>Don’t allow yourself to get in the habit of pouring
water in your dipping cream while dipping
bon bons, as ninety-nine out of every hundred do,
and still know that it will only add to making the
bon bons get dry and hard and spotted much
sooner. Always dip as quickly as possible and only
melt as much cream at a time as you think you
will be able to use. This will avoid your adding
water.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>HOW TO DIP CHOCOLATES IN HOT
WEATHER.</h3>

<p>This recipe or pointer is worth twice the price
of the book. It will do the work in the hottest
weather without fail, and costs about ten or fifteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
cents a day to operate it. Get a good cracker box,
knock off the top cover, and one side of the box;
now take the side piece you have just taken off, put
it on again with two small hinges on the bottom
part, so that it will open and shut in good shape.
Now take the box to a tinsmith and have him make
out of galvanized iron a pan four inches deep and
just the size of the box, to be slipped in on top
where the cover was taken off. Now get a five-cent
staple and clasp and screw it on the side of
the box, so that when the side is closed up it can
be fastened while chocolates are cooling.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>HOW TO USE THE BOX.</h3>

<p>Now, when you get ready to dip chocolate, put
one bucket of ice in the pan, and a cup of salt, and
start to work, and every time you get a pan or
boardfull done, open the side of the box and slip
in the pan of chocolates just dipped; and before
you can dip the next pan this one will be cool and
dry and ready for the store. Keep the side door
always shut while chocolates are in the box, so
as to keep the hot air from same. The bottom of
the pan will then always be dry and avoid sweating
and allowing drops of water to fall upon your
goods. This box can be made at a cost of seventy-five
cents. Don’t fail to try it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span></p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>HOW TO PREPARE CHOCOLATE FOR
DIPPING.</h3>

<p>In preparing chocolate for dipping, a great deal
depends on the grade of chocolate you use. Cheap
chocolate is dear at any price as the profits in
chocolate goods are as great, if not greater, than
many other candies. I would suggest that you use
some brand that is reliable. You can find that kind
advertised in the rear of this book, as I only advertise
those that I know are all right. Any of these,
properly handled, will do good work.</p>

<p>First, melt your chocolate over steam; see that
it is cut up fine, and while melting always stir it
with the hand, instead of a spoon or paddle, as you
can always detect just how hot it is. Don’t get
the chocolate any more than blood warm, then take
it away from the water and let the bulk of the
steam escape, and when the water is just nice and
warm place the chocolate over it again and it will
keep it the same temperature while using it. If
using a cheap brand, add a little nucoa butter and
stir it in well. After you have taken it out and
laid it on the slab or pan, what chocolate you are
going to dip with, work it with your hand until
it feels quite cool. This will prevent the drops
from turning gray; but see that they are cooled off
immediately after being dipped. If you use the
better grade of chocolate you need not use the
nucoa butter, as it contains enough itself, and when
properly handled will prove satisfactory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span></p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>SPECIAL NOTICE.</h3>

<p>You will probably notice that in all my recipes
I quote glucose instead of cream of tartar. I do
this as this book is intended for a class of candy
makers who are just starting and are still young
in the business; also for some who have as yet
never made candies but are just striving to learn;
and as glucose properly handled is equal to if not
a great deal better than the cream of tartar, and
also more profitable, I prefer to give it in all of
my recipes. Of course there must be some common
sense and judgment used, and it is policy not
to use as much glucose in hot weather as in the
severe winter months; therefore you will be able
by experience only to master this point.</p>

<p>Use your own judgment, and if you are bright,
originate new goods, call them some pretty name,
and place them so as to look well in the store. That
is half of the battle won towards becoming a successful
candy maker. Of course it is necessary to
first know the principles of making candy. When
you learn that, have confidence in yourself and go
ahead, and it won’t be long before you will be able
to prepare a great many pretty candies out of a
small quantity of raw material.</p>

<p>In looking over this book you will find that
we have instructed you to prepare a variety of
dainty candies which are made from fondants, nuts,
fruits, etc. This is intended for new beginners,
also for a few old-time candy makers who have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
fallen behind in certain goods and always stick to
one kind the year round and are too busy to look
up new goods or to originate little novelties for
the show case.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>HOW TO MAKE PLASTER PARIS MOLDS.</h3>

<p>Don’t run the plaster paris into starch, as it requires
too much work to whittle them in shape.
For a smooth mold follow these instructions:</p>

<p>Soak in cold water one-half pound of Jap gelatin
for three hours, then put it in the kettle and
cook it, stirring all the time until it is dissolved,
then pour it in a deep pan and let set. Try it once
in a while by sticking your finger in it, and when
the impression you make with your finger does
not close up at once, then put in one of each kind
of molds you wish to get pattern of, and let remain
in gelatin until it gets cold and sets. Then
pick out the molds and mix whatever plaster paris
you wish to use in cold water so that it can be run
through a funnel, and run it in the impressions
made. When they set you can take a pin, pick
them out and refill the impressions a dozen times
if you like and your molds will come out nice and
smooth. Don’t get the plaster paris too thin when
mixing; also use the dentist’s plaster paris, as it
is the best for this use and costs very little more
than the common.</p>

<p>A very soft center for a hand-made chocolate can
be produced by placing eight or ten pounds of bon
bon cream in a one-gallon ice cream can, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
surrounding the can with ice, and leave so for a
few hours; then as your helper takes out of the can
pieces of the cream and rolls them around as you
dip them, you will find after they are dipped that
in less than ten minutes you have a softer center
than you can produce by running cream in starch.</p>

peanuts to suit, and cook until the peanuts pop
and start to smoke and smell good, then pour on
a greased slab; spread out smooth with a rolling-pin;
just before the batch gets cold cut in bars or
in size of the pan you expect to put it in. Bars

Vanilla.</h3>

<p>Melt cream fondants as for bon bons, and then

flavor it with extract of vanilla, then have a glass
of water and a teaspoon, and with the spoon dip in
and take out just half a spoonful at a time, and
with the thumb slip it off on the slab; drop the
spoon in the water every third or fourth time that
you dip them; they will slip off more readily. Continue
this until the batch is finished; let them remain

<hr class="brk"><h3>HONEYCOMB CANDY.</h3>

<p>As this recipe is known by very few candy makers,
I am confident that after you have made it
you will be well pleased with your purchase of this
book. Small batch.</p>

<p class="noindent">Place in kettle</p>

<p class="ingred">
5 pounds sugar,<br>
2 pounds glucose,<br>
Water to dissolve same.<br>
</p>

<p>Cook to 285°; pour it off on the slab; when ready
to handle pull it on the hook and flavor and color
to suit; when well pulled twist the air out of it and
flatten it out in a piece one inch thick and about
one foot long, then lay it before the table furnace;
now place a piece of iron pipe in the center of the
batch and roll the batch round it, close up the left
end of the batch, then get your helper at the other
end; now place the end of a pair of small bellows
and pump air in the pipe, drawing out the pipe
slowly at the same time; when the pipe is all out,
then place the bellows in the hole where the pipe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
was and pump easy; pull out the batch quickly
to about ten feet, then pull out the bellows and
close the end by pressing on it so as to not let the
air out of the batch; now bring both ends together
and pull it again to ten feet long; now bring both
ends together once more, and pull this time the
length of your table if possible; let cool quick as
possible and break in four-inch lengths.</p>


<h4>NOTICE.</h4>

<p>Study this recipe good first and you will see
that the batch is easily made, and by trying one or
two batches you will be able to turn out some nice
goods. The size of the pipe should be fifteen
inches long and two inches around.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>CANDY CHAIN.<br>For Holiday Trade.</h3>

<p  class="noindent">Place in kettle</p>

<p class="ingred">
7 pounds sugar,<br>
3 pounds glucose,<br>
Water to dissolve same.<br>

<p>Cook to 285° and pour on the slab, then pull on
the hook and twist out the air; now flatten it out
in front of your table furnace in a piece about eight
by twelve, and mark a ridge in the center and pour
in a little cotton seed oil, then lay in a small handful
of starch; now get a ball of string and open it
and lay a piece in the center where the oil is and
close the batch around it, pull it out nice and round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
as for stick and then lay the ball of string that is
on the left end of the batch in a box and pull it as
stick and feed it through a kiss machine. Have
the helper keep the batch straight as it comes from
the machine, also watch the ball of string so it
will not get tangled up while you are pulling out.</p>

<p>After you have made one or two of these batches
you can make some very pretty goods, by making
same with stripes and clear centers or clear outside
and pulled centers. This class of goods can
be made only by practice, so don’t get discouraged
if your batch is not perfect after the first attempt.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>TO PREPARE CREAM FONDANT FOR
DIPPING BON BONS.</h3>

<p>When the centers are ready to dip, get your
bon bon kettles ready and put water in one and
place it on the fire, when it starts to boil then put
what fondant you want in the other, and put it
over the other and heat by the steam or hot water;
stir continually and don’t get this too hot, but just
so you can handle it nicely; set it off, flavor and
color to suit. Dip whatever you have ready, one
at a time, lay or drop them on wax paper, let remain
for at least a half hour, then they are ready
for the store.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>
No. 1.      CREAM FONDANT.
</h3>

<p>For Outside Dipping for Bon Bons and Wafers.</p>

<p>Place in a kettle 15 pounds of sugar, with water
enough to dissolve same; cover kettle and let it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
come to a boil, then take off the cover and add ½ a
teaspoonful of cream of tartar, cook to 228°; then
add 1 pound glucose and cook to 238° or 240°;
pour off on dampened slab and let remain until
cold, then cream it by taking a wooden paddle and
working it to and fro until the batch forms into a
lump, then cover it with a damp cloth and let it remain
for one hour; it is then ready to put into a
crock or bucket, and keep covered with a damp
cloth at all times, which keeps it in good condition
until used.</p>

<p>There are plenty of other recipes for making
good fondants, but I think this the best I have
ever used, as it retains a gloss that cannot be obtained
with other creams.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>
No. 2.      CREAM FONDANT.
</h3>

<p>For Outside Dipping of Bon Bons and Wafers.</p>

<p>This is also a good, reliable cream. Use 20
pounds sugar and water enough to dissolve the
batch and cook it to 238°; pour it on the dampened
slab and at once squeeze the juice of 8 lemons
over the batch; let it remain until good and cold,
then cream it as in the usual way.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>
No. 3.      CREAM FONDANT.
</h3>

<p>For Outside Bon Bon Dipping.</p>

<p>Twenty pounds sugar and water enough to dissolve
same; add ½ teaspoonful cream of tartar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
and cook to 238°; sprinkle your slab lightly with
water, pour your batch on and let remain until
cold, then cream it as in the usual way.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>CREAM CENTERS.

<br>For Chocolate Drops and Bon Bons.</h3>

<p>First make whatever impression you wish to
run, by filling your starch boards and taking a
stick that has a straight edge and scraping it from
the top to make a level surface, then make your
impression with your molds that have been previously
stuck on a stick, say 1½ by 18 inches long,
and the molds put half an inch apart; when you
have all the impressions made then put in your
kettle whatever fondant you may want to run and
set it over a very slow fire, and stir until it gets
just hot enough so as when you put your finger
in it feels uncomfortable; set it off at once on a
barrel and flavor and color to suit, and with a
large funnel and round stick to fit the hole in the
funnel and long enough so as you can take hold of
the top, fill this funnel with the fondant, and by
raising the stick and lowering it quickly, start to
fill the impressions in the starch boards; let remain
until hard enough, take out, blow the starch
off of them and they are ready to dip in chocolate
or cream fondant.</p>

<p>This explanation is given for new beginners
only. By adding a few <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: dops" id="dops">drops</ins> of acetic acid to the
above the centers will remain soft much longer.</p>

<p>There are many different ways of making cream

way of his own; but after trying twenty different
ways of making it I find the ones given in this book
give better satisfaction than any of the balance I
have made or seen made.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>NEVER SWEET OR KNEADED
CARAMELS.</h3>

<p>This is <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: wihout" 
id="wihout">without</ins> question one of the best caramels
on the market for the money. I believe this
alone is worth the price of the book. First, place</p>

<p class="ingred">
6 pounds sugar,<br>
3 pounds glucose,<br>
</p>

<p>Water enough to dissolve same, in your kettle,
cook it to 238°; pour it off on the damp slab, and

<p>Stir and cook to 270°; then add half gallon more
cream and cook just to a crack only; set the kettle
off and add the 9 pounds of tough cream you made
on the start, and stir it in until all is well dissolved,
then try it, and if it is a good, firm, hard ball, pour
it on the slab; if not, set it on the fire just a minute
until it is. Pour it on the slab, let remain five
minutes, then fold it all up and cut in three pieces
of equal size; in one piece mix in almonds, in the
other chocolate, and let the other piece remain as
it is; then lay it between the iron bars; with a heavy
rolling-pin roll it out the height of all caramels;
let it remain until cold, then mark and cut.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>No. 1. CARAMELS.</h3>

<p>This recipe for caramels will stand up in the
hottest weather and is the best one I have ever
tried, and it gives satisfaction both to the trade

½ gallon cream.<br>

<p>Stir and cook over a slow fire to a soft ball, or
238°; then add one quart more cream and stir and
cook to a good, firm ball, say about 242°; now add
the other one quart of cream and stir until you

hard ball; pour on slab between iron bars; when

<hr class="brk"><h3>No. 2. CARAMELS.<br>

Chocolate Flavor.</h3>

<p>Proceed same as <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: wih" id="wih">with</ins> vanilla caramel No. 1, only

<p>Proceed as with No. 1 vanilla caramels, only
when the batch is done set it off and stir in whatever
kind of nuts or fruit you may wish before you

chopped up fine; or almonds, pecans, cocoanut,
in fact anything in the line of nuts or fruit you may
have in the shop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span></p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>THREE-LAYER CARAMELS.</h3>

<p>Make a batch of No. 2 chocolate caramels and
pour out on the slab very thin. Now melt 6
pounds of fondant over a slow fire until it gets
just hot enough so as you cannot stand to keep
your finger in it, then pour it over the chocolate
batch and spread it out thin and even; now cook
a batch of vanilla caramels and when done pour
it over the cream batch nice and even; let remain
until cold, then mark and cut. When cutting
these caramels you will find the cream will not
slide out, as with some caramels made from other

it as other fondants and when done cover up with
a damp cloth; let remain for one hour and it is

<hr class="brk"><h3>OPERA CARAMELS.</h3>

<p>Don’t make only such flavors as vanilla, strawberry
and chocolate operas; they are chestnuts
and an eyesore to all, and are made by all candy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
makers, good and bad. First, cut up in small
pieces 1 pound cherries, and set them one side;
then chop up fine 1 pound pecans and 1 pound
English walnuts, and 1 pound pineapple and set
them one side; now chop up ¼ pound of pistachio
nuts, and set them one side; also ½ pound almonds.
You will have now five kinds of operas
to start with; now get the covers of eight five-pound
candy boxes and cover the bottom of each
with wax paper and you will be ready for business.
<ins class="corr" id="weight" title="Transcriber's Note—original text: Weight">Weigh</ins> 2½-pound pieces of opera cream, and
work in each piece the nuts or fruit you have just

all the five kinds are used up. Now fill one with
plain opera cream, lightly flavored with vanilla,
with some color—a delicate pink—and flavor
strawberry, and the other color with chocolate;
now you will have eight kinds of operas. Let
stand a few hours, turn box cover upside down,
tear off the wax paper and mark with a caramel

wafers.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>VARNISH FOR CONFECTIONERY.</h3>

<p>Put ½ pound or more of gum benzoine in a
bottle, pouring in enough fourth-proof alcohol to
cover it; let it stand for at least two weeks, shaking
it well once or twice a day. You may then
pour off gently what you need for immediate use
and let the remainder stand, but not long enough
to become too thick, otherwise it will appear in
streaks on the work when dry. When used it
should be of the consistency of thin syrup; if it
should be too thick dilute with a little alcohol.
This varnish is entirely harmless, and has a fragrance
somewhat resembling that of vanilla. It
has another good quality—it will keep for years,
and grows better with age. It may be used on all
kinds of chocolate work and candies, whether
pulled or clear, giving them a thin, glossy film<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
which protects them from atmospheric moisture
and thus prevents their soon becoming sticky.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>VIOLET CREAM MARSHMALLOWS.</h3>

color, 3 pounds of marshmallows. Have a
bright copper kettle, and put into it the 6 pounds
of best A sugar and ½ pound of glucose; add to
this 2 pints of water; then set the kettle on a bright
fire and cook to 238°; then pour the batch on a
clean slab, allowing it to remain until almost cold;
then with a steel paddle work the batch rapidly
till it turns and sets in a firm mass; now spread a
damp cloth over the mass, leaving it for thirty-five
minutes; then knead the cream and put about
3 pounds in a bon bon dipping-pot; now have
about 3 pounds of marshmallows cut in half with
a pair of shears; now warm the cream in the dipping-pot
and flavor with floral extract of violet
and color a deep violet color; then dip the pieces
of marshmallows in the cream and drop on waxed
paper, and continue till you have dipped all the
marshmallows; and when they are cold they are
ready for use.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>CREAM NOUGAT.</h3>

<p>This is a delicious confection, if carefully made
after the following recipe:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span></p>

<p class="ingred">
1¼ pounds of glucose,<br>
3¼ pounds of white sugar,<br>
1 pint of water,<br>
Whites of 6 eggs,<br>
1 pound of English walnut meats,<br>
3 pounds of Valencia almonds,<br>
Vanilla flavoring.<br>
</p>

<p>Whisk the whites of the eggs in a copper pan
till they are light and stiff; then put ¾ of a pound
of the sugar in a small pan with ½ pint of water
and cook to 250°; pour the hot sugar into the
beaten eggs, at the same time beating the eggs
to make them mix thoroughly with the sugar;
now put the remainder of the sugar into a copper
pan together with the glucose and ½ pint of
water; cook to 260° and then remove from the
fire; stir in the sugar and glucose, and keep stirring
until white and creamy; add the eggs, slowly stirring
them in, and lastly add the almonds, walnut
meats and vanilla flavoring. Now lay nougat
wafers in a frame on your marble and pour the
nougat out on these, also placing the wafers on
the top and a board on top of the wafers. Let the
batch lay over night, and in the morning cut it
into bars of required size.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>CREAM SQUARES.</h3>

<p class="noindent">Put in kettle</p>

<p class="ingred">
8 pounds sugar,<br>
2 pounds glucose,<br>
½ gallon cream,<br>
¼ pound butter.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span></p>

<p>Stir and cook to 250°; set off and pour in about
2 pounds fresh grated cocoanut, stir until batch
just starts to grain, then pour it on the slab, between
the iron bars, and let remain until it grains;
then melt 4 pounds bon bon cream, same as for
bon bons, pour it on the batch, and spread it out
evenly over same. When cold mark with caramel
cutter and cut into squares.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>SALTED ALMONDS.</h3>

<p>Heat 2 quarts of water to a boil, then pour 5
pounds almonds in the water; let them remain a
few minutes; try them by taking one out, and
if the skin or outside slips off pour them out at
once in a sieve, then pour cold water over them,
and after you have taken off all the skins lay them
on a dry towel and let it absorb all the dampness
out of them; now put ½ pound of good butter in
a clean kettle and set it over a slow fire; when the
butter is melted pour in the almonds and stir them
until they start to brown, then pour them out in
a sieve and sprinkle fine salt over them, then
spread them out on a table to cool. Don’t get
them too brown when roasting, as they contain
a good deal of heat when done and will get too
dark and partly burnt by doing so.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>SALTED PEANUTS.</h3>

<p>Place 1 pound of butter in a clean copper kettle
over a slow fire; when the butter is dissolved
add 12 pounds Spanish shelled peanuts, and stir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
them good until the peanuts get through popping
and begin to smoke and get nice and brown,
then at once pour them out into a large sieve and
let the extra butter drop through; then pour them
on the slab or table and pour 1 pound fine salt
over them, and mix them up and then spread them
out to cool.</p>

<p>If the above are roasted nicely you can work
up a large trade on them, as I have made and sold
one hundred pounds per week in different places
where I have made them.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>SALTED PECANS.</h3>

<p>Melt ½ pound of butter in a clean copper kettle
over a slow fire, then pour in 5 pounds of
pecans and stir good only one minute; then pour
them out quickly and finish same as Salted Almonds.
Don’t let them roast too long, as they
turn black and are unfit to eat if they are allowed
to roast too much.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>HOREHOUND ROLLS.</h3>

<p>This piece of goods, when nicely made and put
up in ten-cent rolls, can be made a leader of in
cold weather, as the public at large have great
confidence in the merits of horehound. Make a
batch of horehound candy as per recipe given in
another part of this book, and after it has been
poured on slab divide it in two pieces; one piece
pull on the hook until it turns light brown color,
then form it in a round piece; now knead the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
half, flatten it out around the pulled piece, place
it in front of the table furnace and pull it out in
round sticks the thickness of a broom handle; cut
off in about eight-inch lengths.</p>

<p>These goods show up well when cut, and it is
policy to flavor them highly with horehound—make
them double strength. Don’t wrap them,
but stack them up nicely in dishes or pans. Place
a neat card upon them stating “extra strong horehound
rolls,” and it will add to their sale.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>GINGER BON BONS.</h3>

<p>Proceed the same as with Ginger Chocolate,
only when rolling them out don’t flatten them;
color dipping cream a delicate yellow and dip them
and place on top of each one when dipped a little
thin strip of angelica.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>JAP CHOCOLATES.</h3>

<p>Make a batch of cocoanut Jap and pour it out
on the slab and roll it out in little oblong pieces,
size of a pecan, and dip in chocolate, and have
helper sprinkle a little fine cocoanut on each piece
as you dip them.</p>

flax seed and stir just a moment, then pour on
slab, color a delicate yellow and knead it good,
then form in shape as for stick candy, and then
flatten it out and run through lemon-drop rollers.</p>

<p>These goods look well, as the flax seed show
up all through the drops.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>HOREHOUND FLAX SEED SQUARES.</h3>

<p>Make a batch of horehound candy as per horehound

<p>Cook to hard ball, as for caramels, then add 1
quart cream, and stir and cook again to hard ball;
pour on slab, fold up edges; when cool pull on
hook, then lay it on the slab and chop up in coarse
pieces 2 pounds of almonds and knead them into
the batch; now flatten out the batch between the
iron bars and with rolling-pin flatten out nicely
the thickness of caramels; when cold cut in pieces
one-fourth of an inch wide and one and one-half
inches long, and dip in chocolate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span></p>

<p>The same batch with ground roasted peanuts
in is fine and sells well, and is called Peanut Nougat.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>FRUIT JELLY CHOCOLATES.</h3>

<p>Place 6 pounds of apricot pulp in kettle and the
same weight of sugar, and cook and stir until batch

citric acid and 2 ounces dissolved gelatin;
then add 2 pounds roasted almonds chopped fine;
pour all in taffy pans lined with manilla paper,

when well pulled place on spinning table,
form as for stick candy, and pull out as stick, and
cut with <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: shearse" id="shearse">shears</ins> in small pieces size of a pecan;
lay them in XXXX sugar; sift off the sugar and

4 pounds sugar,<br>
4 pounds glucose,<br>
½ gallon cream,<br>
1 oz. cocoa butter,<br>
2 oz. nucoa butter,<br>
1 pint strained honey.<br>
</p>

<p>Cook to a good, hard ball, not a crack; pour
on slab; cool quick by moving it in cold place on
slab, then pull on hook until quite spongy; when
done flatten it out on slab the thickness of caramels;
when cold mark and finish as other caramels.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>YANKEE NUT CARAMELS.</h3>

<p>Proceed as with above, and when done pulling
add 2 pounds nuts—knead in any kind of nuts you
wish—and roll between iron bars, thickness of
caramels.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>CREAM FIGLETS.</h3>

<p>Grind 5 pounds of figs and knead into it 2
pounds No. 1 dipping cream; use XXXX sugar
and get to a stiff paste; then with the rolling-pin
flatten it out the thickness of mint lozenges, and
with a one-half-inch round tin lozenge cutter cut
them out and throw them in XXXX sugar; when
done sift off the sugar and stack them in dishes for
the show case.</p>

<p>Grind dates, after removing the seeds, and proceed
as with Cream Figlets, and finish the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span></p>

<p>They are good eaters and sell well.</p>

<p>They can both be dipped in chocolate or dipping
cream. They also make a nice piece of goods
in either one.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>CHOCOLATE LAYER NOUGAT.</h3>

<p>Make a batch of Vanilla Nougat, and as you
place it in the box, when finished, put in at first
nougat enough to extend one inch in height, then
cover it with a wafer sheet, then spread over this
dark melted chocolate, and place another sheet of
wafer paper over this; now pour the balance of
nougat on top and then another sheet of wafer
paper.</p>

<p>When this nougat is cut the center shows up
good and is a nice piece of eating.</p>

<p>You can also, if you wish, make a pink or any
other color of nougat and place the chocolate in
the same way. I usually run four or five kinds
of nougat in the above style, as it sets off the
show case to good advantage.</p>

<p>In dipping bon bons, chop up fine any kind of
nuts and flatten them out evenly on the table, and
as you dip a bon bon, drop it on the nuts; when
dry stack them, with nut side up.</p>

<p>These goods look well. You can also color fine
cocoanut pink, yellow or violet, in fact any color
to suit you, and drop bon bons as above. They
also look well.</p>

<p>To color cocoanut do so the same way as you
would color sugar or sugar sand, only omit the
ammonia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span></p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>CREAM RAISINS.</h3>

<p>Open very large raisins, take out the seeds and
stuff them with dipping cream, then crystalize
them. They look well and are nice to top off a
box of candy with. Color some of the dipping
cream violet, pink, yellow, and leave some white.
I always make them in assorted colors, as they
look better and sell better.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>BUTTER-SCOTCH CHOCOLATES.</h3>

<p>Make a batch of butter-scotch patties; run them
small—a little larger than a nickel—then dip them
in chocolate.</p>

<p>They are leaders wherever they are made.</p>

<p>You can also dip the above in dipping cream;
they make a nice piece of goods. In my mind,
anything that tastes well in our line sells well, no
matter if anyone else ever made the same piece of
goods before or not.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>CHOCOLATE-DIPPED CARAMELS.</h3>

<p>It is not necessary to make chocolate caramels
for dipping in chocolate, as it is only a waste of
chocolate. Make a plain vanilla caramel, and when
they are coated the coating itself will be all the
chocolate flavor needed.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>CARAMEL CREAMS.</h3>

<p>Make a nice caramel and cook it a little lower
than for a stand up caramel, and when cold cut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
in size of caramels, and then cut them in two
again and dip in dipping cream. They make a
nice center if cut in two and not cooked too high.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>COCOA DATE CHOCOLATES.</h3>

<p>Open any amount of dates and take out the
seeds, and then place in them fresh grated cocoanut;
close them up, and when ready dip in chocolate.</p>

<p>These goods are good eaters and sell well.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>GINGER CHOCOLATES.</h3>

<p>Cut up in fine pieces ½ pound of ginger and
knead it in 6 pounds of No. 1 dipping cream to a
stiff paste, then roll them out in little balls, and
then flatten them out with the forefinger; when
done dip in chocolate.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>OPERA CREAM DATES.</h3>

<p>Open 5 pounds dates and remove the seeds;
now make a small batch of Opera Cream as per

it out to about one-half inch in thickness; place
iron bars around it, then melt 8 pounds of fondant,

the top of the batch; let set a moment, then turn
over the whole batch carefully and take off the
paper, then place iron bars around again and
spread the balance as before; when cold cut in
small squares. Now cook 10 pounds of sugar,

<hr class="brk"><h3>PLUM CHOCOLATES.</h3>

gelatin and stir and cook to 248° or 250°;
set off on barrel and run the batch into starch

<hr class="brk"><h3>SPUN SUGAR.</h3>

<p>You may and you may not be able to make the
above to look well the first time you attempt it;
but by practice, you will soon be able to turn out
quite a respectable batch. Cook any amount of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
sugar, and water to dissolve it, to 276°, not above
this, and see that you put no more water in than
is enough to dissolve the sugar, as boiling it too
long affects the color of the batch; use about one
pint of water to every 2 pounds of sugar; when
the batch starts to boil cover the kettle and let
the steam wash the sides clean, then take off cover
and when the batch is cooked to 276° set kettle
on a barrel; now have ready two newspapers
spread on the floor, and set a clean, empty sugar
barrel on the center of the paper and with a common
egg whip, or four or five kitchen forks tied
together, dip into the batch and then swing the
forks or egg whip to and fro quickly as possible
across the barrel; continue this until the batch
starts to darken; when at that point it is unfit for
use and must be added to what scraps you have;
pick up the spun sugar and form it as you wish.</p>

of gelatin water, then pour the whole lot together

beater and beat until the batch is good and stiff;
pour it on slab; see that the slab is heavily sprinkled
with XXXX sugar, then with a palette knife
spread it even and sprinkle XXXX sugar over
the top; let stand four or five hours, then cut in
squares size of all marshmallows; in cutting don’t
draw the knife, but press down and cut; have iron

<hr class="brk"><h3>ALMOND CARAMELS.</h3>

<p>Roast 5 pounds large almonds and set them to
one side; then stick into the end of each one the
point of a good, sharp toothpick; the round Chinese
toothpicks are the best; when this is done
cook a small batch of caramel; when done, set the
kettle off on a barrel and dip each one of the
roast almonds in it, then stick the end of the
toothpick in the hole of a fine sieve that must
be turned upside down near your work; continue
this until all is finished, and when the caramel
gets cold pull out the toothpick and you will find
it ready for use and a piece of goods fine enough
for the best retail stores. Don’t let toothpick run
through sieve; place it in sieve on an angle so
that the caramel won’t touch anything; then it
is impossible to tell how they were dipped.</p>

<p>In making a nice batch of Peanut Bar, it is
best to <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: banch" id="banch"> blanch</ins> or husk the peanuts. My way of
doing this is to cook a batch of peanuts as for
Salted Peanuts, but omit the salt; when cold pour
them in a sieve and with the hands rub them until
the husks are loosened, then blow them all off;
put on a batch as for Peanut Bar, only omit the
peanuts, and when the batch is about 280° or
290° set it off on a barrel and stir in the nuts;
then pour on the slab, flatten out nicely between
iron bars; when cold cut in bars to suit.</p>

<hr class="brk"><h3>COCOANUT CAKES.</h3>

<p>This is strictly for the retail trade, and I find this
recipe better than the one where the batch is
grained in the kettle.</p>

<p>Place in kettle 2 gallons of water and set it on
the fire; now put a dishpan over it and place in
it 5 pounds fondant and stir until all the fondant
is well melted, then add two fresh grated cocoanuts
and stir good until well mixed, then set kettle
and all near the slab, set a glass of water on slab,
and now dip a teaspoon in the water, then dip out
a teaspoonful of the mixture and with the thumb
slide it off of the spoon on the dry slab and with
the point of your spoon form it round.</p>

<p class="ingred">
10 pounds glucose,<br>
2 pounds sugar,<br>
1 quart water.<br>
</p>

<p>Cook to 238°; set it off on barrel; now take a
large wooden bowl, or if you have none use a small
sized washtub, and pour into it a pail of water,
then empty it out at once; this is done just to make
the tub damp; now place in the tub about 20
pounds fine powdered cocoanut, and as your helper
pours over it a dipperful of the batch just cooked,
you stir it in good with a paddle; continue this until
you cannot possibly stir in another pound, then
pour it out on a slab and flatten it out the height
of your bars with a rolling-pin; let set one hour,
and cut to suit.</p>

<p>Another way to finish this is to flatten out two-thirds
of the batch, then color the other third a
light pink and flatten it out over half of the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
batch then cut the third not covered and lay it
over the red, and when this is cut in slices it will
leave the red center.</p>

<p>After cutting Jap lay it in granulated sugar;
then sift or shake off the sugar and place in boxes

set it on the table and add and stir in a little water;
don’t get it too thin; and when cold pour in bottle
for use.</p>

<p>You can omit the water if you wish and thin
it with glucose and form a paste; but as you have
very little use for it the water is good enough for
retail shops.</p>

<hr class="brk"><h3>TO COOK SUGAR FOR CRYSTALIZING.</h3>

<p>This all depends on how heavy a crystal you
wish; and as there are no two candy makers who
work alike it will lay with you whether you like
a light crystal or a heavy one.</p>

<p>Place any amount of sugar you wish in kettle,
and add plenty of water to dissolve it; see that
sides of kettle are clean, and cook by a syrup gauge
to 33½° for light, 34 or 35½° for heavy crystal.</p>

<p>Let crystal remain in the same kettle it is cooked
in; don’t disturb it until you wish to pour it over
the goods you wish to crystalize, which is cooked,
before it is ready to use.</p>

<p>Experience alone will teach you on this point;
nevertheless, if you follow the above advice you
will be able to crystalize goods in a respectable
manner.</p>

piece into a stiff cream by adding XXXX sugar;
now roll out each piece to about eighteen inches

round; cut up in four pieces so as to handle easily,
and roll them until you get a long strip which is
about as thick, or a little thicker, than stick candy;

side on the bottom of a taffy pan; let them remain

show the cream as in common cream dates, then
sand them in granulated sugar.</p>

<p>The above goods can also be dipped in fondant
or chocolate, and are a fine piece of goods.</p>

<p>In dipping bon bons, you can sometimes use
glycerine, by pouring a little of it in the cream;
it has a tendency to keep the bon bons a little
softer, and they will not become hard and dry as
soon as without the above.</p>

above batch have your helper get the center ready,
so as when you take it from hook it is ready for
you; make the center of warm No. 1 fondant, by
placing the fondant in front of table furnace and
adding a little XXXX sugar in it; get it good and
warm, as a cold center will cause the outside to
crack when pulling or cutting.</p>

<p>You can cook 2 pounds of glucose just to a boil,
then set off on a barrel, stir in ground nuts of any
kind or ground figs to a stiff paste. This is a
good center and quickly made.</p>

<p>Every candy maker has his own way of making
centers for buttercups, but I find the above good
enough, as they sell as good as any I know of. In
fact, buttercups and Boston chips are back numbers
and out of date in most parts of the country.</p>

<p>In making buttercups practice alone will teach
you, as there are so many kinds of centers, and
outside wrappers, some with stripes, some plain
white; also others colored pink, violet, green; some
with outside not pulled, but clear; so you will find
out that experience alone will teach you to make
a nice line of the above goods.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>CINNAMON BON BONS.</h3>

<p>Take 4 pounds of No. 1 fondant and knead into
it ½ teaspoonful of ground cinnamon, then pick
up little pieces and roll them out the size of marbles;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
when done dip them in No. 1 fondant and
have helper sprinkle on each bon <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: bn" id="bn">bon</ins> just a little

<p class="noindent">Place in kettle</p>

<p class="ingred">
8 pounds sugar,<br>
2 pounds glucose,<br>
Water to dissolve same.<br>
</p>

<p>Cook to 230°; pour on slab; pour on batch ½
ounce of tartaric acid and ½ ounce of extract of
ginger; knead the batch good till all is well worked
in, then form it in shape and run through small
lemon drop rollers.</p>

<p>In running cream in starch prints for bon bons
or chocolates, you will find by adding a few drops
of acetic acid to the cream just before filling the
impressions that it will have a tendency to make
the centers softer.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>MAPLE WALNUT CHOCOLATES.</h3>

<p>Dip any amount of English walnut halves in
maple fondant, then dip them in chocolate.</p>

<p>This is a good combination and sells well.</p>

3 pounds maple sugar,<br>
4 pounds glucose,<br>
1 pint water.<br>
</p>

<p>Cook to 230°; then pour in 7 pounds of fine
grated cocoanut and stir and cook to a good soft
ball; pour on slab in one pile, and form little balls
out of it about the size of marbles; when cold dip
them in chocolate.</p>

<p>You can also dip the above in maple fondant;
they are nice eating and sell well.</p>

<p>By making batch of nougat, such as maple
nougat, using dark brown sugar, you will find you
will have a fine piece of goods, and one hard to
imitate by others, as the above sugar gives it a
rich and peculiar flavor.</p>

<hr class="brk"><h3>STICK CANDY.</h3>

<p class="ingred">

2 pounds glucose,<br>
Water to dissolve same.<br>
</p>

<p>Cook to 310°; pour on slab; fold up at once,
and cut off about 1 pound and color it a dark red;
set it where it will keep warm; now pull the large
piece good and white, and flavor peppermint while
pulling; twist air out and then flatten it out on the
spinning table and form it in a square piece; now
roll out the red piece and cut it into four pieces,
flatten one of them wide, and place it on the white
batch the length of it, then place the other three
pieces on as the first, in different places, and then
form the whole batch round; then take one end of
it and raise it up and pull up till you get it in shape
of a long-necked bottle, then lay batch down and
pull out in stick size the length of the table; have
your helper twist one end while you help him on
the other; when done, keep rolling the sticks until

one pound yellow and pull it on hook, and knead
into the main piece 1½ ounces of tartaric acid, and
leave it clear; form it as for peppermint and top off
with lemon stripes, and finish as the peppermint
batch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span></p>

<p>In making stick candy canes, cut off the lengths
you want on an angle, and see that one end is a
little smaller than the other; have helper roll them
until he sees they are getting cold, if he bends
them too soon the canes look flat and it affects the
sale of them.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>HOREHOUND STICK.</h3>

<p>Proceed as for horehound squares, only run the
caramel cutter over the batch one way, then with
a large batch knife mark the lengths by pressing
with the knife; when cold take hold at the end,
and they break much easier.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>LEMON CUTS.</h3>

around the first batch and pull out the same as
buttercups, cutting them with your buttercup
cutter. This is a very fine eating piece, and you

for your candy factory, your soda fountain or your
ice cream.</p>

<p>In soliciting the advertisements of supply houses
for this book, I have only asked those whom I
know and whose goods I have used. You will
find any material you get from them to be of the
best quality.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>LONDON CONFECTIONERY.

<br>Comment on This Book.</h3>

<p>Rigby’s Reliable Candy Teacher.—There is a
considerable call amongst workers in this country
for reliable recipe books in connection with the
confectionery trade. There is such a constant
change taking place in the methods of manufacture,
and so rapid is the introduction of new
lines and variations of old lines, that it is a difficulty
with a number of workers to keep up with them.
A number of these improvements and novelties
come from America, and whatever may be the
opinions of manufacturers on the opposition which
they may meet in business from American manufacturers,
there are no two opinions upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
alacrity with which the Yankee notions are seized
and adapted to the business in this country. A
number will therefore welcome the appearance of
a practical and reliable guide on confectionery,
which has been published by Mr. W. O. Rigby,
and which is known as “Rigby’s Reliable Candy
Teacher,” and contains over 500 recipes for the
manufacture of popular confections and summer
drinks. There is one thing always to be admired
about the American works in connection with
trade recipes; they do not elaborate for the mere
purpose of extending the book, the directions are
given in a plain and straightforward fashion, and
this work is no exception to the rule. Whilst Mr.
Rigby characterises his book as a “humble little
work,” he at the same time takes pains to state
that it contains twenty years’ experience in the
leading cities of the United States, an experience
which he is prepared to place at the disposal of the
readers. He lays claim to having published in it
the largest number of creditable recipes for making
candy ever presented in a single work. The first
portion of the work is taken up with a few general
hints in regard to the business. Then chocolates,
moulds, fondants, caramels, opera creams, taffy,
cocoanut goods, French nougat, and all kinds of
novelties are treated. The book is well printed in
large type, with paper covers.</p>

<h3>THE SODA FOUNTAIN.</h3>

<p>Your soda fountain, and everything attached to
the fountain, should be above suspicion as to cleanliness.
Your counter top, glasses, crushed fruit
jars, spoons, etc., should be perfectly clean.</p>

<p>Add a small amount of common soda or some
of the well-known washing powders to a bucket of
water and keep under your counter to wash your
ice cream soda glasses in, afterwards rinsing them.</p>

<p>Don’t hire a cheap boy to run your fountain;
a boy may be cheaper than a man, but people have
confidence in a man that a boy cannot inspire.</p>

<p>Use all the ice possible; it don’t pay to skimp on
ice.</p>

<p>Every morning wash all your glasses and all of
the fountain fixtures with good soapsuds.</p>

<p>Always serve cream with all the syrups that
you can; never ask a customer if he wants cream;
give it to him whether he asks for it or not. Of
course, use some judgment; don’t serve cream with
lemon ginger ale, and such syrups.</p>

<p>Always keep a gallon or half-gallon bottle of
each kind of syrup in your reserve stock. This
should be labeled and kept in your cellar or some
cool place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span></p>

<p>Fruit juices cost more than <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: extracats" id="extracats">extracts</ins>, but it
pays to use them in your soda water. Use a fruit
juice such as you will find advertised in the rear
of this book and your customers will come again.</p>

<p>If a customer breaks a glass don’t accept pay for
it; look pleasant; it was an accident.</p>

<p>Have stools in front of your fountain counter;
but you must be careful lest you have loafers.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to have two or three tables, or
as many more as is necessary, to accommodate
your trade, and chairs for them, to serve ice cream
soda. This is popular with ladies.</p>

<p>Always serve a small glass of ice water with
your ice cream soda.</p>

<p>If it is possible, make your own ice cream; then
you avoid getting good ice cream one day and
poor the next. If you want something very fine
for fountain trade, use our formula No. 1.</p>

<p>Don’t sell ice cream soda for five cents just because
your competitor does; give them something
good and charge them ten cents; you will find your
customers will be willing to pay that if you give
them good soda. Always keep a good line of
crushed fruits; do not use preserves. Get your
crushed fruits from some good reliable house that
makes this a business. See <ins class="corr" 
title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: avertisement" id="avertisement">
advertisement</ins> in rear
of book.</p>

<p>Have your fountain clerk dressed in white coat
and apron; never allow him to wear soiled linen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span></p>

<p>Do not cover your fountain top to prevent it
from getting dirty; it takes but little time to wash
it, and it is too fine a fixture to hide by covering
it up.</p>

<p>Have your silver polished frequently; it gives
your fountain the appearance of cleanliness.</p>

<p>Egg drinks can be made very popular and
profitable by exercising care in their mixture.</p>

<p>Be liberal in your soda advertising, as it is the
best paying part of your store during summer
seasons, if properly attended to.</p>

<hr class="brk"><h3>EXTRACTS.</h3>

<p>We give you a few formulas for the manufacture
of extracts, but we advise you to buy them of
some reliable house that makes this a business.
See advertisement in rear of book:</p>

<p>1. Extract of Aniseed—Aniseed, ground,
twelve ounces; alcohol, five pounds.</p>

<p>2. Angelica—Angelica root, twelve ounces;
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;added text: alcohol" id="alcohol" >alcohol,</ins> five pounds.</p>

<p>7. Orange—Orange peelings, fresh, two
pounds; alcohol, five pounds.</p>

<p>Great care should be taken when peeling these
fruits, so as not to cut the inner white skin, but
only the yellow part, because the white of both the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
lemon and the orange has a bitter taste and will,
when introduced into the extract, spoil the fine
flavoring quality of these fruits.</p>

<p>8. Nutmeg—Ground nutmeg, twelve ounces;
alcohol, five pounds.</p>

<p>9. Cloves—Whole cloves, twelve ounces; alcohol,
five pounds.</p>

pound; alcohol, five pounds.</p>

<p>21. Bitter Almonds—Oil of bitter almonds, six
ounces; alcohol, five pounds.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>CARBONATED WATERS.</h3>

<p>My advice, especially to the smaller dealers, is
to have some reliable bottling company make your
carbonated waters; but if you use a great deal of
it, and are situated so that you can carbonate your
own waters, use the carbonic acid gas cylinders.
One of the cylinders will charge from 80 to 100
gallons of water. This will make your founts cost
you about twenty-five cents for ten gallons.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>THE WAY TO DRAW ICE CREAM SODA.</h3>

<p>First place your ice cream in your glass, then
your crushed fruits, then turn on fine soda stream
until glass is filled. This makes the finest ice
cream soda it is possible to make. My mode of
drawing is entirely different from any other soda
experts.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>MAKING SOLID DRINKS.</h3>

<p>In drawing solid drinks put the syrup in first,
then use an eight-ounce mineral glass to draw
your plain soda in. Add your phosphate to your
syrup if required, and mix by throwing from one
glass to the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span></p>

<p>Never use shaved ice in soda water, as it spoils
your soda and makes it flat tasting. Shaved ice
should be used for no other purpose at a soda
fountain but for the manufacture of glaces. In
making egg drinks don’t use shaved ice, but
cracked ice, small lumps, as this breaks your egg
up and is strictly necessary in this mixture.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>GLACES.</h3>

<p>Glaces are made by shaving ice in an ice shaver
into small glass mugs. After you have filled your
glass mug with crushed ice, use a long soda spoon
to make a hole in the middle of the ice; fill this with
crushed fruit, or any flavor that you like, shave a
little more ice on top, and it is ready for the
customer.</p>

<p>This is a very profitable drink and the most
popular flavors are cherry, strawberry, orange,
peach, raspberry, pineapple, plum, apricot and
claret.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>CITRIC ACID SOLUTION.</h3>

<p>Put 5 pounds of crushed citric acid and 1 pint
of water into a galvanized iron kettle and bring to
gentle boil, constantly stirring, immediately filtering
through paper into gallon bottle; add enough
warm water to fill bottle; keep well corked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span></p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>RED COLOR FOR SODA SYRUPS.</h3>

<p>Take 1 ounce of No. 40 carmine and add 4
ounces of alcohol; let stand for a short time and be
very careful in using it, as it is very strong and
necessitates only a few drops to a gallon of syrup.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>HOT SODA.</h3>

<p>In making hot soda, it is not necessary to use
carbonated water. Get a coffee urn—a fancy
nickel plated one—and keep hot water in it all the
time. Use great care in keeping this urn cleaned
out. Hot soda has not been as thoroughly advertised
by the soda fountain people throughout
the United States as it should have been. I find
hot soda business very profitable if properly conducted.
Use small, thin china cups and saucers.
I prefer the plain instead of the decorated, as they
look much cleaner and neater. Most of the extracts
used in making hot drinks are prepared, but
I shall give you a few that I manufacture myself
and find them to give better satisfaction and are
cheaper than those I can buy.</p>

<p>Salt, pepper, nutmeg and celery salt, are four
articles that should be kept in small salt cellars to
set on your soda counter. Don’t use ice cream
soda spoons, but get a dozen small-sized teaspoons.
Have cream pitcher and sugar bowl to match your
cups.</p>

<p>Place in one phosphate bottle 1 pint of alcohol
and 1 pint of oil of orange, sweet; color this pink;
now fill another phosphate bottle with citric acid
solution.</p>

<p>This can be served with any syrup, but the most
popular are such as phosphates, lemon, orange,
cherry, grape, raspberry.</p>

<p>Draw 2 ounces of your syrup, then fill half full
of cracked ice and a couple of dashes out of each
bottle. Serve same as phosphate, in small eight-ounce
mineral glasses.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>CREAM FRAPPE.</h3>

<p>This is a very popular and profitable drink and
a ten-gallon fount full of frappe will net you $38.70
and cost you $1.60 to make it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span></p>

<p>First dissolve 8 ounces of Coxe’s gelatin in ½
gallon of hot water; now filter 7 gallons of cold
water into a ten-gallon fount; add 1½ gallons of
simple syrup and 8 ounces of vanilla extract; now
strain the gelatin water into a dishpan and color
a blood red; add it to the balance in ten-gallon
fount and charge to 160° solid. After the fount is
charged the blood red will turn into a delicate
pink and the vanilla kills the taste of the gelatin.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>ABOUT SUNDAES.</h3>

<p>This has become one of the most popular dishes
served at the soda fountain. The one thing that
should be first in your mind is the service used.
Your champagne glasses, or your Sundae cups
should be either silver, glass or china, but always
thin and dainty in design. A special spoon smaller
in size than your soda spoons and a small silver
tray should be used.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>MERRY WIDOW SUNDAE.</h3>

<p>Put one disher of Ice Cream in a Champagne
glass, then cover with crushed cherries, place nuts
on crushed cherries, then crushed pineapple on
nuts; place five cherries around edge of glass and
one on top. This is a big hit of the large cities.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>TANGERINE SUNDAE.</h3>

<p>Take a Tangerine orange cut in half, remove the
fruit. Care should be taken not to break the skin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
Fill the half with vanilla ice cream, now pour on a
ladle of crushed orange over the cream. Cut some
long narrow strips of the orange peel, about 4 of
them and place them on ice cream, running up
and down.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>PUFFED RICE SUNDAE.</h3>

<p>Place a small disher of vanilla ice cream in a
champagne glass; sprinkle a small amount of
puffed rice over and around the ice cream then a
few ground nuts. Top with a cherry.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>CASSIA SUNDAE.</h3>

<p>Place a small disher of caramel ice cream in a
champagne glass, sprinkle shredded cocoanut over
this, then a small amount of ground cinnamon over
this.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>MARSHMALLOW SUNDAE.</h3>

<p>Place a small disher of vanilla ice cream in a
champagne glass, cut some marshmallows in
halves; place a row around your ice cream; pour
a ladle of strawberry stock over the ice cream; now
place a marshmallow on top and a cherry on the
marshmallow.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>CANTELOUPE SUNDAE.</h3>

<p>Take a nice cold ripe canteloupe, cut in half,
clean the seeds out; place a disher of vanilla ice
cream in the canteloupe; pour a ladle of ground
nuts over the ice cream; top with crystalized violet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span></p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>ORIENTAL FRUIT SUNDAE.</h3>

<p>Place in Champagne glass, small spoonful of
ground Lichee nuts, then disher of vanilla ice
cream; place ground figs ½ way round the ice
cream, then ground dates the other half; then place
small pieces of figs and dates cut up on the ice
cream. Top with cherry.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>RAINBOW SUNDAE.</h3>

<p>Place in a champagne glass, half a disher of
strawberry ice cream; ½ disher of vanilla ice
cream; half a ladle of crushed pineapple on one
side, half a ladle of cherries on the other. Top with
crystalized mint leaf.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>CHERRY SUNDAE.</h3>

<p>Place a disher of ice cream in your glass or cup;
then a good, big ladle of whole cherries mixed
with some syrup; have a few extra large Maraschino
cherries under your counter and place one
of these on top of your ice cream.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>MAPLE NUT SUNDAE.</h3>

<p>Place a disher of vanilla ice cream in your sundae
cup or glass; now pour about one ounce of
maple syrup over the ice cream, then sprinkle
about one tablespoonful of chopped nuts over this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span></p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>STRAWBERRY SUNDAE.</h3>

<p>Place a disher of ice cream in your sundae cup
or glass, then have some nice ripe strawberries
crushed, mixed with syrup and powdered sugar;
then place 2 or 3 whole strawberries on top of this.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>PLAIN SYRUP SUNDAES.</h3>

<p>Sundaes can be made with any syrup, or flavors
used at the soda fountain. Simply use the plain
ice cream and pour your flavor desired over it. The
same rule applies to nut sundaes. Some fountains
carry four or five different kinds of ground nuts,
but I do not think this is necessary, as it is very
hard when the mixture is made to distinguish the
kind of nut used. The main thing is to be sure
the nuts are absolutely fresh, and not rancid.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>HOW TO USE CREAM FRAPPE.</h3>

<p>Serve with any flavor. In drawing syrup for
frappe use 1½ ounces on the glass. For instance:</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>CHOCOLATE FRAPPE.</h3>

<p>Draw 1½ ounces of chocolate syrup in soda
glass; now fill glass one-third full of frappe; then
fill balance of glass with heavy soda stream; now
pour from one glass to the other, then turn just
a little frappe on top, and you have one of the
most inviting drinks imaginable.</p>

<p>Twenty different drinks can be made from this
recipe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span></p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>FRAPPE FOR EGG DRINKS.</h3>

<p>First draw your syrup, 1½ ounces to the glass;
add your egg and cracked ice, then shake in
shaker, then add one-third of an eight-ounce mineral
glass full frappe, throwing from one glass to
the other, then draw just a little frappe on top and
sprinkle with ground nutmeg.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>FRAPPE WITH ICE CREAM SODA.</h3>

<p>After you have your ice cream soda ready to
serve, but not quite filled to the top, fill glass up
with frappe. This is especially popular with ladies.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>NOTICE.</h3>

<p>In giving you recipes in all these sherbets I
have made the amount of sugar the same.</p>

<p>Now, in a great many sherbets it is necessary
to use more sugar than others. The amount to be
used in each one can be ascertained only by one’s
own taste. Taste your sherbet as you prepare it.
When you have it the sweetness desired, then it
ought to be satisfactory. In the amount of fruit
used it is not strictly necessary to follow my directions
as to the amount used in all these recipes,
but make them stronger or weaker, as you like.
I simply give these proportions, such as I find give
the best satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span></p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>BANANA SHERBET.</h3>

<p class="ingred">
3 quarts water,<br>
6 pounds XXXX sugar,<br>
About 15 very ripe bananas,<br>
White of one egg.<br>
</p>

<p>Press them through a fine sieve into your sugar
and water, then add 1 ounce of citric acid solution;
strain all through a sieve into the freezer, and
freeze.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>No. 1. CURRANT SHERBET.</h3>

<p class="ingred">
3 quarts water,<br>
6 pounds XXXX sugar,<br>
3 quarts of ripe red currants,<br>
White of 1 egg.<br>
</p>

<p>Press them through a fine sieve; add them to
your sugar and water, with 1 ounce of citric acid
solution; strain into freezer, and freeze.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>No. 2. CURRANT SHERBET.</h3>

<p>Mash 2 quarts red currants and 1 quart of red
raspberries, add 6 pints rock candy syrup; place

</p>

<p>Press the berries through a fine sieve, add them
to your sugar and water, and strain all through a

<hr class="brk"><h3>No. 2. STRAWBERRY SHERBET.</h3>

<p>Proceed same as above, only when preparing
berries simply crush them up well and put in whole.
This mode is used quite extensively in some parts
of the country, but I prefer the first recipe, because
the berries being put in whole causes them
to freeze in lumps.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>PEACH SHERBET.</h3>

<p class="ingred">
3 quarts water,<br>
6 pounds powdered sugar,<br>
White of 1 egg.<br>
</p>

hair sieve, then add 1 ounce of citric acid solution;
strain through a sieve into your freezer, then
freeze.</p>

<p>In making peach sherbet crack about 6 of the

3 quarts water,<br>
6 pounds powdered sugar,<br>
White of 1 egg.<br>
</p>

<p>About 2 quarts very ripe wild goose plum, or
any other variety that is not too flat tasting. I
prefer the wild goose plum, as it produces a better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
flavor than most others. Remove the seeds
and press them through a fine sieve and add 1
ounce of citric acid solution; strain all through
sieve into your freezer, and freeze.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>RASPBERRY SHERBET.</h3>

<p class="ingred">
3 quarts water,<br>
6 pounds XXXX sugar.<br>
</p>

<p>Take 3 quarts of fresh, ripe raspberries; don’t
use red raspberries, as they are too flat-tasted; use
the black ones; press them through a fine hair
sieve, then add this to your sugar and water; then
add white of 1 egg, and strain all through a sieve
into your freezer, and freeze.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>No. 1. ORANGE SHERBET.</h3>

<p>Take 3 quarts of water, add 6 pounds powdered
sugar, boil for twenty minutes; remove from fire,
add the juice of 40 oranges; let cool; strain, and
add the whites of 3 eggs.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>No. 2. ORANGE SHERBET.</h3>

<p>Squeeze out juice of 20 oranges and 12 lemons;
add 6 pints rock candy syrup, ½ ounce citric acid
and whites of 2 eggs; also grate the rinds of 3
oranges and color a delicate orange color, then
freeze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span></p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>LEMON SHERBET.</h3>

6 pineapples, cut up fine,<br>
White of 1 egg.<br>
</p>

<p>Press through a fine hair sieve; add 1 ounce of
citric acid solution; strain into freezer, and freeze.</p>

<p>Canned pineapple can be used instead of fresh
pineapple. Use two cans of grated instead of the
6 whole ones.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>POINTERS ON FREEZING.</h3>

<p>In all my recipes for making ice creams I tell
you to strain your cream and sugar through a fine
sieve. I do this as a precaution, thus avoiding
flies and other small foreign particles being in
your cream after it is frozen. Care should be exercised
in turning your freezer. Start slowly and
at the finish turn very rapidly. By turning slowly
at the start it avoids the producing of butter on
the dasher, and by turning rapidly at the finish it
swells your cream. I think it a good idea after
you are through freezing to wash the top of your
freezer off good before removing; it thus avoids
small particles of salt falling in your cream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span></p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>POINTERS ON RE-PACKING ICE CREAM.</h3>

<p>When you re-pack your cream, if it is soft take
your long wooden ice cream paddle and work it
up and down, mixing your ice cream thoroughly,
then pack it with an extra lot of salt with your ice.
This is especially necessary after cream has stood
a couple of days. In packing ice cream I think it
is strictly necessary to use porcelain lined cans, as
it will not do to pack ice cream and let it stand in
a tin can more than one day.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>ICE CREAM.<br>Vanilla.</h3>

<p>This recipe is for pure cream, and I consider
it the finest of my recipes, being very simple.</p>

<p>To each gallon of cream use 1¾ pounds of
XXXX powdered sugar. To each gallon of
cream use 1 ounce of vanilla.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>ICE CREAM.<br>Vanilla.</h3>

<p>Two gallons milk boiled quickly, stirring constantly;
take off the fire and stir in 5 pounds of
sugar and ½ gallon condensed milk, then strain
through cloth and let cool. When cool add 3½
gallons of cream and 4 ounces of vanilla extract,
and freeze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span></p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>NEW YORK ICE CREAM.</h3>

<p>Three gallons of cream, 3¼ pounds of powdered
sugar, the whites and yolks of 21 eggs; beat them
up good, add them to your sugar and cream, and
it is ready to freeze. This makes a very rich yellow
cream.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>ICE CREAM.<br>Vanilla.</h3>

<p>This recipe is given for a very cheap article of
ice cream. Take 1 quart of milk, add 1½ ounces
of gelatin. This gelatin must be dissolved in 1
pint of hot water before using; then dissolve 1¼
pounds of sugar in 3 quarts of cold milk; strain
this into freezer, add 1 ounce vanilla extract, then
stir briskly for a minute; then it is ready for the
freezer.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>VANILLA ICE CREAM.</h3>

<p>First beat 18 eggs, whites and yolks, then add</p>

<p class="ingred">
2½ pounds of powdered sugar,<br>
2 gallons fresh milk,<br>
3 ounces vanilla extract.<br>
</p>

<p>This makes a good ice cream and a very cheap
one.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM.</h3>

<p class="ingred">
1 gallon cream,<br>
1¾ pounds XXXX sugar,<br>
3 quarts fresh strawberries.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span></p>

<p>Press them through a fine hair sieve, mix this
with your sugar and cream and strain all through
a fine sieve into the freezer, and freeze.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>PEACH ICE CREAM.</h3>

<p class="ingred">
1 gallon cream,<br>
1¾ pounds XXXX powdered sugar.<br>
</p>

<p>Take 15 large, ripe peaches—it is necessary that
they be dead ripe—remove the seeds and press
them through a fine hair sieve; add them to your
sugar and cream, then strain all through a fine
sieve into your freezer, then it is ready to freeze.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>ORANGE ICE CREAM.</h3>

<p class="ingred">
1 gallon cream,<br>
1¾ pounds XXXX sugar.<br>
</p>

<p>Take 6 ripe oranges, grate the peel, then press
the oranges and peel through a fine hair sieve;
mix with sugar and cream and strain all through
a fine sieve; then add a few drops of oil of orange,
and it is ready to freeze.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>LEMON ICE CREAM.</h3>

<p class="ingred">
1 gallon cream,<br>
1¾ pounds XXXX sugar.<br>
</p>

<p>Then grate four lemons and press lemons and
gratings through a sieve into your sugar and
cream; add a few drops of oil of lemon, color a
delicate yellow, then strain all through a fine hair
sieve, and it is ready to freeze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span></p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>HOKEY POKEY ICE CREAM.</h3>

<p>Dissolve 5 ounces corn starch in 2 gallons of
milk; add 4 pounds sugar; set on a slow fire until
it boils so it thickens; take from the fire; add</p>

<p class="ingred">
5 ounces vanilla extract,<br>
½ gallon cream,<br>
Whites of 12 eggs,<br>
2 ounces gelatin.<br>
</p>

<p>Dissolve in hot water; stir it up well and strain
through a fine hair sieve; let it stand until it gets
cool, then freeze, then put in molds and pack in
tub of ice; let it stand one or two hours, then cut
in slices and wrap in wax paper.</p>

<p>This will stand lots of exposure before it will
melt.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>TUTTI FRUTTI ICE CREAM.</h3>

<p class="ingred">
1 gallon cream,<br>
1½ pounds sugar.<br>
</p>

<p>Cut up very fine ¾ pound of French cherries
and pineapple; let them soak in brandy a short
time, then add to the cream and sugar, and freeze.
Soaking the fruits in brandy improves them in
flavor and keeps them from freezing in hard lumps.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>CURRANT ICE CREAM.</h3>

<p class="ingred">
1 gallon cream,<br>
2 pounds XXXX sugar,<br>
3 pints fresh, ripe currants.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span></p>

<p>Press them through a fine hair sieve; either
color a delicate pink or let it remain white so the
currants will show in the cream.</p>

<p>It is necessary to use more sugar in making this
cream because the currants being sour it must
have more sweetness to offset the acid in the fruit.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>PLUM ICE CREAM.</h3>

<p class="ingred">
1 gallon cream,<br>
1¾ pounds XXXX sugar.<br>
</p>

<p>Take 8 ounces crushed fruit, or 3 pints very ripe
wild goose plum; press through a fine sieve. Do
not color, as I think it looks much better with that
creamy look the plums produce.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM.</h3>

<p class="ingred">
1 gallon cream,<br>
1¼ pounds XXXX sugar,<br>
8 ounces extra heavy chocolate syrup.<br>
</p>

<p>Stir all together well and strain through a fine
sieve; then it is ready to freeze.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>PISTACHIO ICE CREAM.</h3>

<p class="ingred">
1 gallon cream,<br>
1¾ pounds XXXX sugar.<br>
</p>

<p>Strain through a fine sieve, then add ¼ pound
pistachio nuts, ground very fine, and a little pistachio
extract; you can add a little green color or
leave it white so the green nuts will show in it;
then it is ready to freeze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span></p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>VIOLET ICE CREAM.</h3>

<p class="ingred">
1 gallon cream,<br>
1¾ pounds XXXX sugar.<br>
</p>

<p>Strain through a fine sieve, then add a little
violet color and violet extract; then it is ready to
freeze.</p>

<p>This makes a very pretty cream for receptions
or very fine trade.</p>


<hr class="brk"><h3>NUT ICE CREAM.</h3>

<p>Six different kinds of Ice Cream can be made
after this recipe. They are</p>

<p>English Walnut, Filbert, Almond, Pecan, Brazil,
Hickory.</p>

<p>And still only having one kind of ice cream
vanilla in stock.</p>

<p>Grind about 1 pound of each kind of the above
nuts, keep them in small tin boxes where you dish
your ice cream; first fill your disher, or measure,
half full of cream, then put a big teaspoonful of
the ground nuts into the disher, then fill up with
ice cream.</p>

<p>When you turn it out into the dish sprinkle a
few nuts over the top and it is ready to serve.</p>

<p>I have worked this scheme at the leading summer
resorts of Minnesota and a number of places
in Florida.</p>

<p>Your competitor will hear you are running so
many different kinds of ice cream, and if he don’t
know how to make nut cream this way he will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
mix the ground nuts in with his cream and freeze
each kind separately, making it necessary to carry
a much larger stock than you do.</p>

<strong>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</strong>


<p>Illustrations in this eBook have been positioned between paragraphs
and outside quotations. In versions of this eBook that support
hyperlinks, the page references in the List of Illustrations lead to
the corresponding illustrations.
</p>
<p>Illustrations without captions have had a description added, this is denoted
with parentheses.</p>

<p>The index was not checked for proper alphabetization or correct page
references.</p>

<p>Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been
corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within
the text and consultation of external sources.</p>

<p>Some hyphens in words have been silently removed, some added,
when a predominant preference was found in the original book.</p>

<p>Except for those changes noted below, all misspellings in the text,
and inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained.</p>
