INTRODUCTORY


In presenting this work to the army of candy makers of America, I
give them the benefit of my twenty years’ experience. I make no great
pretensions and deny that I am the only candy maker on earth, but
think the fruit of my twenty years’ experience, expressed in this
little volume, will be a benefit to any one who may have the fortune or
misfortune to possess it.

The aim of the author is to present this work in plain common-sense
language, so that the average candy maker can readily digest its
contents. I modestly lay claim to having published in this volume the
largest number of creditable recipes for making candy ever presented in
a single work. Also, that it is positively the only candy book strictly
up to date that can be of any service to the retailer.

In issuing this new and revised edition, I have indexed the recipes,
added new ones, noted improvements in the way of handling old ones, and
given a few hints on window decorations.

Since issuing the first edition of this book, in 1897, new ideas have
been brought out and new varieties introduced; and it is the intention
of the author to keep this work fully up to date.

Wishing my patrons unlimited success in the use of my book, I am,

                                               Yours respectfully,
                                                            W. O. Rigby.

CLEANLINESS A NECESSARY FEATURE.

Of all places, a candy shop should be a model of cleanliness. Make this
a strict rule and always adhere to it.

Visitors often inspect your kitchen, and of course form opinions. These
opinions cannot be creditable to any extent if your place is not neat
and tidy. The opinions visitors form on such tours of inspection will
do much to build up your trade or tear down your patronage, and make
you a reputation. In my mind it is the most essential step toward a
successful candymaking business.

Don’t be afraid that your helper will learn candymaking; a good
helper—one that takes an interest in his work—will more than repay you
for the trouble in teaching him, in the additional help you get out of
him.


PLAIN TALK TO THE EMPLOYE.

Success in any business is rarely ever obtained by any man who lacks
sobriety. The candy maker is no exception to this rule, as all our
formulas are carried in our heads, after we become proficient in
the business, and a close-thinking brain is indispensable. Wages are
decided by worth. If the man who preceded you in your present position
received twelve or fifteen dollars a week, is that any reason you
should receive the same amount? You may not be worth twelve dollars,
and you may make yourself worth more. Strict attention to business,
making your employer’s interests your own, working a little overtime if
necessary, all increase your worth to your employer, and he will not be
slow to recognize it in a substantial manner.

The oldest candy maker is not always the best candy maker, and is not
always worth the greatest wages. The young man of ability, integrity,
honesty and hustling qualities is the winner.


WINDOW DECORATIONS.

One thing I wish to impress upon the mind of every reader of this book;
that is, too much attention cannot be given to your display window.
I consider this one-half the store. A neat and tasty display will
attract people to your window, and nine times out of ten they will see
something to tempt their appetites.

Keep your window clean and well lighted; change the display in them
every other day; keep neat, tasty signs on your goods; introduce new
and novel features.

I will give you a few ideas on window decorations:


DISPLAY NO. 1.

Cover the bottom of your window with clean paper; then empty a barrel
of granulated sugar in the window; make a pile in center, and four
small piles, one on each corner; place on the center pile three cakes
of sweet or bitter chocolate. Now place on a white china plate a pile
of chocolate creams, one for each corner pile, and now run a row of
chocolate creams from each corner pile to the center pile. Then place a
sign on this display as follows:

                   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
                   *     Our Candies Are Pure.     *
                   * Nothing but the Purest of the *
                   *     Pure enters into the      *
                   *      manufacture of our       *
                   *       Queen Chocolates.       *
                   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


DISPLAY NO. 2.

Dump a whole bag of raw Spanish shelled peanuts into the window. In the
center place a large bowl of salted peanuts, place a nice silver scoop
in the peanuts, and the following sign in front of the bowl:

                    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
                    *     Our Salted Peanuts      *
                    *  Are made fresh every day.  *
                    *     They’re Delicious.      *
                    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


DISPLAY NO. 3.

Place a number of empty five-pound candy boxes tastily in your window.
Take fancy colored cheese cloth, covering window boxes and all; puff it
up, place a dish of bon bons daintily piled on each box, make a pile of
your one-pound candy boxes at the back, bring to a pile in the center,
and place a palm or other plant at each rear corner of the window.

The following sign will add to the display:

                    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
                    *      Smith’s Candies.       *
                    *         ’Nuff Sed.          *
                    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


DISPLAY NO. 4.

Cover and drape your entire window in violet colored cheese cloth;
pin bunches of cheap cloth or paper violets in various places in the
window; fill small fancy baskets with violet ribbon tied on handles,
with crystalized violets, violet colored bon bons, violet tipped
chocolates, or any candies of violet color.

Sign as follows:

                    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
                    *      Beautiful Colors       *
                    *             in              *
                    *     Beautiful Candies.      *
                    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


DISPLAY NO. 5.

Cover and drape your entire window in American Beauty colored cheese
cloth. Pin large paper or cloth roses about the window, fill baskets
with pink bon bons, tie red ribbon in basket handles, run strings of
red roses from center of top of window to each corner; make a large
tray of pink candy chips, and set in rear center of window; place palm
or plant of some kind at rear corners of window.

Following sign with large bow of red ribbon in the corner:

                    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
                    *   Fair as a Rose was She,   *
                    *  Made happy with a box of   *
                    *       Smith’s Candy.        *
                    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


DISPLAY NO. 6.

Fill bottom of window with crushed white stone; make a pile of larger
stones in one corner, leaving a space in the center of the pile; line
the inside with red colored tinfoil; place a light inside—an electric
light with red globe is preferred. Now sprinkle coarse salt over the
rock, like snow. Make a log cabin out of stick, which can be easily
done, and place in one corner; build a small bench to set in front of
cabin, get two or three small toy figures of men, place them about
in different places. Make a large pile of Klondike Nuggets (see page
99); have a sign painter paint a curtain to go across the back of the
window, representing a field of ice and snow. Place the following sign
in the window:

                    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
                    *      Klondike Nuggets,      *
                    *      25 Cents per Box.      *
                    *    The Latest in Candy.     *
                    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Pack in half-pound boxes.


DISPLAY NO. 7.

Cover bottom of window with pink crepe paper; fill as many half-pound
boxes as you can get into the window, arranging them tastily with fig
glaces (see page 98). Fill a large platter with fine layer figs and
place on each side.

Use the following sign:

                    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
                    *         Fig Glaces.         *
                    *  A Delicious Fruit Goodie—  *
                    *        —25c box.—           *
                    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


DISPLAY NO. 8.

Cover bottom of your window with white or cream colored paper, also a
board back about six feet high. Now cut some bright red crepe paper
in strips about one inch wide; run these strips across bottom, fasten
one end, then twist. After you have them twisted enough to look well,
fasten the other end. Now run strips from front top of window down to
board back, twisting them before you fasten both ends. Now make a fancy
design with your red strips on front of board back. Fill entire window
with mint drops—white color with red stripes—and display the following
sign:

                    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
                    *   Old-Fashioned             *
                    *         Peppermint Kisses.  *
                    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


DISPLAY No. 9.

Have a large pan made—large enough to hold a fifty-pound chunk of ice.
Have hole made in one corner and provide a way to run the waste water
into some receptacle. Place chunk of ice in pan; dig a hole in center
of chunk, fill four glasses with green colored water and set on each
corner of chunk of ice, fill hole in center with fresh mint sprigs, run
a row of fresh mint around edge of pan.

Place the following sign on the mint:

                    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
                    *   Try Our Mint Phosphate    *
                    *       It’s Delicious.       *
                    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Make a display of bottled goods around this display. (For making mint
phosphate see soda formulas.)


DISPLAY No. 10.

Cover bottom with cloth, paper, or some other material; fill entire
window with butter-scotch (see page 78) and pile up well.

                    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
                    *       Butter-Scotch—        *
                    *  Like Mother Used to Make.  *
                    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Individual display is always a good way to dispose of any particular
article you wish to push. An entire window trimmed in caramels,
chocolates, hoarhound drops or marshmallows will make them sell.

During the summer, if your windows are not closed, think it is a
good idea not to trim them, as the goods get dirty, and covered with
flies, giving one the impression that your goods are all like the ones
displayed in your windows. Better to keep a few nice plants in your
window.


A WORD TO THE EMPLOYER.

When your candymaker has exercised his skill in preparing your
confections, see that they are properly cared for after being placed in
the store. By the carelessness of inexperienced clerks many candies are
ruined and rendered unfit to sell to the better class of trade.

Bon bons should never be stacked high in the show case shortly after
being made, because they are soft and will not stand pressure.

Some clerks, in selling chocolates or candies of any kind, handle them
as if they were lumps of coal, instead of exercising the greatest
care and gentlest touch. Too great attention cannot be paid to this
feature of the business. A clerk must learn this, and if after a
reasonable time does not, is unfit for the business and should seek
some occupation where brains are in less demand.

In piling bon bons on your dishes or trays, place a sheet of heavy wax
paper between each layer. This will prevent them from sticking.


HOW TO ARRANGE YOUR SHOP.

Arrange your shop with a view to economy of time. A man working in a
poorly arranged shop will walk many extra miles during a day’s work.
Place your furnace in a well-lighted place; it will save gas bills and
enable you to always see the condition of your batch, providing the
draft is not cut off to any extent. Sugar, glucose and water are used
in almost all candies, therefore have them side by side; you cannot
easily move the sink, so move your sugar, glucose and scales as near it
as possible.

Keep a pail of clean water beside your furnace, and when not using
your paddle place it in the water; this will prevent the paddle from
becoming sticky and collecting filth, which condition it is generally
in when not cared for in this manner.

Be sure and have your starch room separate from the rest of your shop,
even if you have to make an enclosure in one corner of your kitchen.
If so, muslin or some other cheap fabric will answer the purpose. Also
leave your candy slab so as to afford ample room on every side of it.
Your spinning table should be as long as your room can accommodate, and
at least three or three and a half feet wide. Never allow your flavors
and colors to become mixed on one shelf. Lumber is cheap, so have lots
of shelf room to spare, so when you start after a certain flavor you
will not have to overhaul your whole stock of bottles to find it. It
might be well to arrange them in alphabetical order. Have a separate
shelf for your raw material, such as shelled nuts, chocolate, cocoa
butter, paraffin, etc.

In dipping chocolate, provide yourself with oilcloth covered boards of
a convenient size, about twelve by eighteen inches, as the oilcloth is
superior to wax paper, and cheaper. These boards should be placed, when
filled with chocolates, in a rack, which should be located in as cool
a place as possible. These boards may be used for bon bons by covering
them with wax paper. Nails are cheap, so have a nail for everything
that is made to hang up, and see that it hangs there. See that your
coal box is as near the furnace as possible. I would suggest that the
kindling for tomorrow’s fire be prepared the night before. If possible,
have two candy hooks in the shop, as they can be had for a song. Your
candy thermometer should be placed in a can of water, which should be
directly behind the stove; this will keep the tube free from gummy
candy, so that the figures can easily be read, and it will also be more
accurate. A small bin, say three by six feet and twelve inches high,
will be very useful for mixing your candies in in the fall of the year,
and it will cost very little to put it up. Have it placed in one corner
of your room when not in use for candy. It can be used to advantage
for a great many purposes. Also hang a good, strong dipper over the
glucose barrel, for use, and do not get into the filthy habit of taking
it out with your hands. By pouring at least two quarts of cold water
into the glucose barrel when first opened, the glucose will run out so
much easier and will not adhere to the dipper in the least. Also have
a good, strong barrel near your furnace, to set your kettle on when
stirring your batch; you will avoid an accident, such as tipping while
stirring, and also keep your floor in a good, tidy condition.

If I have failed to mention some things in this article, exercise
your own good judgment, with the idea of convenience always uppermost
in your mind, and time will tell you of your business foresight in a
substantial manner.

As this book will fall into the hands of some who have never made
candy, I will add the following points:

First. In making taffies, be sure that your slab or marble is always
clean and well greased. I would suggest that it be greased with cotton
seed oil, or some reliable slab dressing such as you will find
mentioned in the rear of this book, as it is far better than lard and
never becomes rancid. This of course is known by all candy makers and
will be looked at lightly by them, as they know all of these points;
but, as I have said before, as this book will fall in the hands of new
beginners, I will endeavor to place all the information possible before
them so that they will be able to understand just what to do and avoid
mistakes from the start.

Second. In cooking hard candies, such as tablets, buttercups, ocean
waves, stick candy, or in fact any kind of candy that is cooked over
280° and is to be pulled on the hook or handled, you must use while
doing so a pair of buckskin gloves or mittens, as they not only protect
the hands but also give the goods a fine gloss.

I will no doubt use a great many plain words in all formulas, but it
is for the purpose of making all the points in candy making so plain
that a new beginner will have no trouble to understand just what to do,
and if he will follow out my instructions, just as I have placed them
before him, I am satisfied that he will become proficient in the art of
candy making in a short time.


POINTER IN MELTING CHOCOLATE FOR DIPPING.

When you prepare chocolate for dipping, and should you find out that
you have no cocoa butter in stock for thinning it, add a little Nucoa
butter. It will answer the purpose and is equal to cocoa butter, and
also cheaper.

By mixing equal parts of bitter and sweet chocolate you will have a
better colored and better eating chocolate than by using only sweet
chocolate.


NOTICE.

Whenever you cook a batch of candy that contains cream and is to be
pulled upon the hook, see that the batch is one-half glucose and
one-half sugar, as cream in a pulled batch has a tendency to grain in a
short time. Therefore, remember this and avoid grained batches.


A POINTER ON DIPPING BON BONS.

Don’t allow yourself to get in the habit of pouring water in your
dipping cream while dipping bon bons, as ninety-nine out of every
hundred do, and still know that it will only add to making the bon bons
get dry and hard and spotted much sooner. Always dip as quickly as
possible and only melt as much cream at a time as you think you will be
able to use. This will avoid your adding water.


HOW TO DIP CHOCOLATES IN HOT WEATHER.

This recipe or pointer is worth twice the price of the book. It will
do the work in the hottest weather without fail, and costs about ten
or fifteen cents a day to operate it. Get a good cracker box, knock
off the top cover, and one side of the box; now take the side piece
you have just taken off, put it on again with two small hinges on the
bottom part, so that it will open and shut in good shape. Now take the
box to a tinsmith and have him make out of galvanized iron a pan four
inches deep and just the size of the box, to be slipped in on top where
the cover was taken off. Now get a five-cent staple and clasp and screw
it on the side of the box, so that when the side is closed up it can be
fastened while chocolates are cooling.


HOW TO USE THE BOX.

Now, when you get ready to dip chocolate, put one bucket of ice in the
pan, and a cup of salt, and start to work, and every time you get a
pan or boardfull done, open the side of the box and slip in the pan of
chocolates just dipped; and before you can dip the next pan this one
will be cool and dry and ready for the store. Keep the side door always
shut while chocolates are in the box, so as to keep the hot air from
same. The bottom of the pan will then always be dry and avoid sweating
and allowing drops of water to fall upon your goods. This box can be
made at a cost of seventy-five cents. Don’t fail to try it.


HOW TO PREPARE CHOCOLATE FOR DIPPING.

In preparing chocolate for dipping, a great deal depends on the
grade of chocolate you use. Cheap chocolate is dear at any price as
the profits in chocolate goods are as great, if not greater, than
many other candies. I would suggest that you use some brand that is
reliable. You can find that kind advertised in the rear of this book,
as I only advertise those that I know are all right. Any of these,
properly handled, will do good work.

First, melt your chocolate over steam; see that it is cut up fine,
and while melting always stir it with the hand, instead of a spoon or
paddle, as you can always detect just how hot it is. Don’t get the
chocolate any more than blood warm, then take it away from the water
and let the bulk of the steam escape, and when the water is just nice
and warm place the chocolate over it again and it will keep it the same
temperature while using it. If using a cheap brand, add a little nucoa
butter and stir it in well. After you have taken it out and laid it on
the slab or pan, what chocolate you are going to dip with, work it with
your hand until it feels quite cool. This will prevent the drops from
turning gray; but see that they are cooled off immediately after being
dipped. If you use the better grade of chocolate you need not use the
nucoa butter, as it contains enough itself, and when properly handled
will prove satisfactory.


SPECIAL NOTICE.

You will probably notice that in all my recipes I quote glucose instead
of cream of tartar. I do this as this book is intended for a class of
candy makers who are just starting and are still young in the business;
also for some who have as yet never made candies but are just striving
to learn; and as glucose properly handled is equal to if not a great
deal better than the cream of tartar, and also more profitable, I
prefer to give it in all of my recipes. Of course there must be some
common sense and judgment used, and it is policy not to use as much
glucose in hot weather as in the severe winter months; therefore you
will be able by experience only to master this point.

Use your own judgment, and if you are bright, originate new goods, call
them some pretty name, and place them so as to look well in the store.
That is half of the battle won towards becoming a successful candy
maker. Of course it is necessary to first know the principles of making
candy. When you learn that, have confidence in yourself and go ahead,
and it won’t be long before you will be able to prepare a great many
pretty candies out of a small quantity of raw material.

In looking over this book you will find that we have instructed you
to prepare a variety of dainty candies which are made from fondants,
nuts, fruits, etc. This is intended for new beginners, also for a few
old-time candy makers who have fallen behind in certain goods and
always stick to one kind the year round and are too busy to look up new
goods or to originate little novelties for the show case.


HOW TO MAKE PLASTER PARIS MOLDS.

Don’t run the plaster paris into starch, as it requires too much work
to whittle them in shape. For a smooth mold follow these instructions:

Soak in cold water one-half pound of Jap gelatin for three hours, then
put it in the kettle and cook it, stirring all the time until it is
dissolved, then pour it in a deep pan and let set. Try it once in a
while by sticking your finger in it, and when the impression you make
with your finger does not close up at once, then put in one of each
kind of molds you wish to get pattern of, and let remain in gelatin
until it gets cold and sets. Then pick out the molds and mix whatever
plaster paris you wish to use in cold water so that it can be run
through a funnel, and run it in the impressions made. When they set you
can take a pin, pick them out and refill the impressions a dozen times
if you like and your molds will come out nice and smooth. Don’t get
the plaster paris too thin when mixing; also use the dentist’s plaster
paris, as it is the best for this use and costs very little more than
the common.

A very soft center for a hand-made chocolate can be produced by placing
eight or ten pounds of bon bon cream in a one-gallon ice cream can, and
then surrounding the can with ice, and leave so for a few hours; then
as your helper takes out of the can pieces of the cream and rolls them
around as you dip them, you will find after they are dipped that in
less than ten minutes you have a softer center than you can produce by
running cream in starch.

  No. 1.      COCOANUT KISSES.

Vanilla.

Melt cream fondants as for bon bons, and then stir in all the long
strip cocoanut it will stand; then set it off on one corner of your
slab; now flavor it with extract of vanilla, then have a glass of water
and a teaspoon, and with the spoon dip in and take out just half a
spoonful at a time, and with the thumb slip it off on the slab; drop
the spoon in the water every third or fourth time that you dip them;
they will slip off more readily. Continue this until the batch is
finished; let them remain on slab five minutes and they are ready to
pick up, put in pans or dishes for the store.


  No. 2.      COCOANUT KISSES.

little dark chocolate and stir until chocolate is thoroughly dissolved;
finish same as No. 1.


COCOANUT ROSE.

  4 pounds glucose,
  2½ pounds sugar,
  No water.

Cook to 250° over a slow fire, then pour in all the wide strip cocoanut
you can possibly stir in and just as the cocoanut starts to brown pour

Use fresh sliced cocoanut for this.


  No. 1.       COCOANUT DIAMONDS.

  6 pounds glucose,
  2 pounds sugar,
  Water to dissolve same.

Cook to 242°; set off on a barrel and add all the fine powdered
cocoanut you can possibly stir in; flavor vanilla, and pour on a dry,
clean slab; roll it out with a rolling-pin the height of the bars; when
cold, mark with a caramel cutter, straight one way and on the angle the
other; this will allow you then to get them in the shape of a diamond.
When they are cut, throw them in a sieve and throw granulated sugar
over them, shake the sieve until sugar is out and they are ready for
the store.


  No. 2.      COCOANUT DIAMONDS.

Proceed as with No. 1, and you can color the syrup after it is off the
fire any color or flavor you wish. They are made in vanilla, rose,
chocolate and strawberry.


HONEYCOMB CANDY.

As this recipe is known by very few candy makers, I am confident that
after you have made it you will be well pleased with your purchase of
this book. Small batch.

Place in kettle

  5 pounds sugar,
  2 pounds glucose,
  Water to dissolve same.

Cook to 285°; pour it off on the slab; when ready to handle pull it on
the hook and flavor and color to suit; when well pulled twist the air
out of it and flatten it out in a piece one inch thick and about one
foot long, then lay it before the table furnace; now place a piece of
iron pipe in the center of the batch and roll the batch round it, close
up the left end of the batch, then get your helper at the other end;
now place the end of a pair of small bellows and pump air in the pipe,
drawing out the pipe slowly at the same time; when the pipe is all out,
then place the bellows in the hole where the pipe was and pump easy;
pull out the batch quickly to about ten feet, then pull out the bellows
and close the end by pressing on it so as to not let the air out of the
batch; now bring both ends together and pull it again to ten feet long;
now bring both ends together once more, and pull this time the length
of your table if possible; let cool quick as possible and break in
four-inch lengths.


NOTICE.

Study this recipe good first and you will see that the batch is easily
made, and by trying one or two batches you will be able to turn out
some nice goods. The size of the pipe should be fifteen inches long and
two inches around.


CANDY CHAIN.

For Holiday Trade.

Place in kettle

  7 pounds sugar,
  3 pounds glucose,
  Water to dissolve same.

Cook to 285° and pour on the slab, then pull on the hook and twist out
the air; now flatten it out in front of your table furnace in a piece
about eight by twelve, and mark a ridge in the center and pour in a
little cotton seed oil, then lay in a small handful of starch; now
get a ball of string and open it and lay a piece in the center where
the oil is and close the batch around it, pull it out nice and round
as for stick and then lay the ball of string that is on the left end
of the batch in a box and pull it as stick and feed it through a kiss
machine. Have the helper keep the batch straight as it comes from the
machine, also watch the ball of string so it will not get tangled up
while you are pulling out.

After you have made one or two of these batches you can make some very
pretty goods, by making same with stripes and clear centers or clear
outside and pulled centers. This class of goods can be made only by
practice, so don’t get discouraged if your batch is not perfect after
the first attempt.


TO PREPARE CREAM FONDANT FOR DIPPING BON BONS.

When the centers are ready to dip, get your bon bon kettles ready and
put water in one and place it on the fire, when it starts to boil then
put what fondant you want in the other, and put it over the other and
heat by the steam or hot water; stir continually and don’t get this too
hot, but just so you can handle it nicely; set it off, flavor and color
to suit. Dip whatever you have ready, one at a time, lay or drop them
on wax paper, let remain for at least a half hour, then they are ready
for the store.


  No. 1.      CREAM FONDANT.

For Outside Dipping for Bon Bons and Wafers.

Place in a kettle 15 pounds of sugar, with water enough to dissolve
same; cover kettle and let it come to a boil, then take off the cover
and add ½ a teaspoonful of cream of tartar, cook to 228°; then add 1
pound glucose and cook to 238° or 240°; pour off on dampened slab and
let remain until cold, then cream it by taking a wooden paddle and
working it to and fro until the batch forms into a lump, then cover it
with a damp cloth and let it remain for one hour; it is then ready to
put into a crock or bucket, and keep covered with a damp cloth at all
times, which keeps it in good condition until used.

There are plenty of other recipes for making good fondants, but I think
this the best I have ever used, as it retains a gloss that cannot be
obtained with other creams.


  No. 2.      CREAM FONDANT.

For Outside Dipping of Bon Bons and Wafers.

This is also a good, reliable cream. Use 20 pounds sugar and water
enough to dissolve the batch and cook it to 238°; pour it on the
dampened slab and at once squeeze the juice of 8 lemons over the batch;
let it remain until good and cold, then cream it as in the usual way.


  No. 3.      CREAM FONDANT.

For Outside Bon Bon Dipping.

Twenty pounds sugar and water enough to dissolve same; add ½
teaspoonful cream of tartar, and cook to 238°; sprinkle your slab
lightly with water, pour your batch on and let remain until cold, then
cream it as in the usual way.


CREAM CENTERS.

For Chocolate Drops and Bon Bons.

First make whatever impression you wish to run, by filling your starch
boards and taking a stick that has a straight edge and scraping it from
the top to make a level surface, then make your impression with your
molds that have been previously stuck on a stick, say 1½ by 18 inches
long, and the molds put half an inch apart; when you have all the
impressions made then put in your kettle whatever fondant you may want
to run and set it over a very slow fire, and stir until it gets just
hot enough so as when you put your finger in it feels uncomfortable;
set it off at once on a barrel and flavor and color to suit, and with
a large funnel and round stick to fit the hole in the funnel and long
enough so as you can take hold of the top, fill this funnel with the
fondant, and by raising the stick and lowering it quickly, start to
fill the impressions in the starch boards; let remain until hard
enough, take out, blow the starch off of them and they are ready to dip
in chocolate or cream fondant.

This explanation is given for new beginners only. By adding a few drops
of acetic acid to the above the centers will remain soft much longer.


CREAM FONDANT.

For Running in Starch for Centers for Bon Bons and Chocolates.

  30 pounds sugar,
  10 pounds glucose,
  Water enough to dissolve the same.

Cook to 238°; pour on a dampened slab, let remain until cold; cream it
as No. 1 fondant.

There are many different ways of making cream for fondants. Almost
every candy maker has a way of his own; but after trying twenty
different ways of making it I find the ones given in this book give
better satisfaction than any of the balance I have made or seen made.


NEVER SWEET OR KNEADED CARAMELS.

This is without question one of the best caramels on the market for the
money. I believe this alone is worth the price of the book. First, place

  6 pounds sugar,
  3 pounds glucose,

Water enough to dissolve same, in your kettle, cook it to 238°; pour it
off on the damp slab, and start to cream it at once, which will make it
a good tough cream; now set it to one side; now place in kettle

  8 pounds sugar,
  16 pounds glucose,
  ½ pound nucoa butter,
  2 oz. cocoa butter,
  ½ gallon cream.

Stir and cook to 270°; then add half gallon more cream and cook just to
a crack only; set the kettle off and add the 9 pounds of tough cream
you made on the start, and stir it in until all is well dissolved, then
try it, and if it is a good, firm, hard ball, pour it on the slab; if
not, set it on the fire just a minute until it is. Pour it on the slab,
let remain five minutes, then fold it all up and cut in three pieces of
equal size; in one piece mix in almonds, in the other chocolate, and
let the other piece remain as it is; then lay it between the iron bars;
with a heavy rolling-pin roll it out the height of all caramels; let it
remain until cold, then mark and cut.


No. 1. CARAMELS.

This recipe for caramels will stand up in the hottest weather and is
the best one I have ever tried, and it gives satisfaction both to the
trade and the proprietor.


CARAMELS.

Vanilla.

Put in clean copper kettle

  4 pounds sugar,
  3 pounds glucose,
  4 oz. nucoa butter,
  ½ gallon cream.

Stir and cook over a slow fire to a soft ball, or 238°; then add one
quart more cream and stir and cook to a good, firm ball, say about
242°; now add the other one quart of cream and stir until you get a
good, hard ball; not to a crack, but a good, hard ball; pour on slab
between iron bars; when cold, mark and cut.


No. 2. CARAMELS.

Chocolate Flavor.

Proceed same as with vanilla caramel No. 1, only when you add the last
quart of cream add also ½ pound dark, bitter chocolate, and finish as
with No. 1.


No. 3. CARAMELS.

Maple.

Proceed as with No. 1 vanilla caramels, only use 4 pounds maple sugar
instead of the white, and finish as with No. 1 caramel.


No. 4. CARAMELS.

Proceed as with No. 1 vanilla caramels, only when the batch is done set
it off and stir in whatever kind of nuts or fruit you may wish before
you pour it off. You can use figs or Brazil nuts chopped up fine; or
almonds, pecans, cocoanut, in fact anything in the line of nuts or
fruit you may have in the shop.


THREE-LAYER CARAMELS.

Make a batch of No. 2 chocolate caramels and pour out on the slab very
thin. Now melt 6 pounds of fondant over a slow fire until it gets just
hot enough so as you cannot stand to keep your finger in it, then pour
it over the chocolate batch and spread it out thin and even; now cook
a batch of vanilla caramels and when done pour it over the cream batch
nice and even; let remain until cold, then mark and cut. When cutting
these caramels you will find the cream will not slide out, as with some
caramels made from other recipes.


No. 1. OPERA CREAM.

For Opera Caramels.

Put 20 pounds of sugar in a clean copper kettle and add

cool; then with a paddle cream it as other fondants and when done cover
up with a damp cloth; let remain for one hour and it is ready for use.


OPERA CARAMELS.

Don’t make only such flavors as vanilla, strawberry and chocolate
operas; they are chestnuts and an eyesore to all, and are made by all
candy makers, good and bad. First, cut up in small pieces 1 pound
cherries, and set them one side; then chop up fine 1 pound pecans and 1
pound English walnuts, and 1 pound pineapple and set them one side; now
chop up ¼ pound of pistachio nuts, and set them one side; also ½ pound
almonds. You will have now five kinds of operas to start with; now get
the covers of eight five-pound candy boxes and cover the bottom of each
with wax paper and you will be ready for business. Weigh 2½-pound
pieces of opera cream, and work in each piece the nuts or fruit you
have just prepared and lay it in the box cover; keep on until all the
five kinds are used up. Now fill one with plain opera cream, lightly
flavored with vanilla, with some color—a delicate pink—and flavor
strawberry, and the other color with chocolate; now you will have eight
kinds of operas. Let stand a few hours, turn box cover upside down,
tear off the wax paper and mark with a caramel cutter, but don’t cut
them up in pieces, only as they are sold; put them in nice clean pans
and when the people see eight kinds of operas it will sell them quicker
than gazing at those three chestnuts—vanilla, strawberry and chocolate.

THREE GRACES.

A Nice Piece of Chocolate Goods.

First roll out by hand from bon bon cream a lot of little balls the
size of large filberts, then select a few pounds of large filberts and
roast them in a sieve over the fire, and then rub the husks off; now
get half a pound of candied cherries. Now, when dipping this piece of
goods in chocolate I always dip the cherry first, then the cream ball;
set it next to the cherry; then dip the filbert; set it next to the
cream filbert. As I dip the filbert I drop a line of chocolate with the
thumb across the three pieces; this makes them one.

These goods eat well, as it is a fine combination and nice for topping
off a box of candy.

the balance, and twist all the air out of it, then place it in front of
the table furnace in a three-cornered piece about a foot long and with
the piece you have colored make two or three strips and lay it on each
corner of the batch, then pull it in lengths of two or three feet; see
that they remain three-cornered, pull them in thickness of large lead
pencil and have your helper place one hand on each end and turn the
piece in the opposite direction, until it is evenly twisted; when cold
cut in length of jar you intend to place them in.

These goods made in assorted colors and flavors look very well and
readily bring 40 cents per pound.


A GOOD BROKEN MIXED.

Make a small batch of all the taffies and cook them to about 290° or
300°; then after they are pulled and flavored flatten them out in front
of the table furnace and pull them in sticks about one inch wide, and
while you are doing this have your helper mark them on an angle of
about two inches in length, push them to one side, and when cold they
can be easily broken where marked and will be in a diamond shape; then
add to this mixture a batch of peanut candy, cut in two-inch squares,
then add a batch of cocoanut taffy cut same as peanut; when this is
done put 5 pounds sugar and 2 pounds glucose in a kettle, with water to

vanilla; now pour the peanuts in a clean dishpan and hold it about a
foot high from the fire and have your helper pour a little at a time
on the batch, while you keep shaking pan; keep on doing this until all
the batch is used up, and if the peanuts are not coated thick enough
to suit you, place on three or four more pounds of sugar and cook as
before and continue to pour on until they are of a size suitable to
your taste.

½ ounce of menthol and cover it with a little of the starch. Fold up
the edges of the batch and knead well; when cool enough to handle, fold

kneading it.

Peppermint.

Melt over steam in your bon bon kettle 5 pounds bon bon fondant, stir

cream as for Peppermint Patties; when melted don’t flavor, but color to

long and then sand them in XXXX sugar.


HOW TO MAKE SUGAR SAND.

Place whatever amount of sugar you wish to color on a dry and clean
slab or table; now add a few drops of whatever color you wish to color
it, and with both hands rub it together good until all is equally
colored, then add a few drops of ammonia and rub it in good, as this
will keep the color from fading out. Use candy colors for the above.


HOW TO SAND LEMON HOREHOUND OR ANY KIND OF HARD GOODS FOR SUMMER USE.

Place the kettle, with a few gallons of water in it, on the fire; when
it starts to boil place whatever goods you wish to sand in a coarse
sieve and shake it over the steam of the kettle, and when they feel
damp pour them at once into a pile of granulated sugar, and with the
hands mix them up good; put them all in the sieve again and shake all
the loose sugar out and they will be ready for use.

out thin with rolling-pin and fold it around the loaf you have just
made until it is entirely covered; when cold cut in slices like cake.

Cook to 252°; then add quickly 1 pint molasses and stir and cook again
to 252°; set off the fire and add ½ teaspoonful soda and 1 pound black
walnut meats; stir in kettle until it starts to grain, then pour it in
one pile on a warm slab, scrape it all up, form it in the shape of a
loaf of bread and keep it in that shape until it sets and gets hard;
cut in slices as sold.

This is a good seller and takes wherever I have made it.


BUTTER-SCOTCH WAFERS.

  5 pounds sugar,
  1 pound glucose,
  Water to dissolve same,

Cook to 270°; then add

  ¼ pound butter,
  1 oz. dark molasses.

  6 pounds sugar,
  ½ pound glucose,
  Water enough to dissolve same.

Cook to 300° or 320° over a hot fire; pour on slab, fold up and color
to suit, and pull on hook; then twist the batch on the hook until
all the air is out of it, then put it on the table in front of table
furnace and form it in shape as for stick candy. Take hold of one end
and form as a bottle, small at one end; have some one help you and as
you pull the batch out long and about the size of straws, have your
helper keep them off of each other and move them around until they
become cold. After making one or two batches you will be enabled to
make these goods uniform and neat; also flavor while pulling, and use
gloves, as they retain more of a gloss.

These goods make a fine show and help sell other goods. For a window
show they cannot be beaten. Make these goods all colors and flavor them
highly, and when cold break up and mix in one pan. They show up well.


SOFT CHEWING BUTTER-SCOTCH.

  5 pounds light brown sugar,
  2 pounds glucose,
  2 oz. nucoa butter,
  ½ pound butter,
  Water to dissolve same.

Cook and stir until batch is 250°; set off and flavor with oil of
lemon; pour on greased slab, between iron bars; when cold cut in pieces
two by three inches and wrap in wax paper.

  Water to dissolve same,
  1 pint New Orleans molasses,
  ¼ pound butter.

Heat 1 quart of water to a good boil, then add 1 ounce of horehound
herb and let stand fifteen or twenty minutes, then put 5 pounds sugar
and 1 pound glucose in a kettle; now pour the horehound water through
a strainer and cook to 280° or 290°; pour in funnel and finish as
molasses wafers.


VARNISH FOR CONFECTIONERY.

Put ½ pound or more of gum benzoine in a bottle, pouring in enough
fourth-proof alcohol to cover it; let it stand for at least two weeks,
shaking it well once or twice a day. You may then pour off gently what
you need for immediate use and let the remainder stand, but not long
enough to become too thick, otherwise it will appear in streaks on the
work when dry. When used it should be of the consistency of thin syrup;
if it should be too thick dilute with a little alcohol. This varnish
is entirely harmless, and has a fragrance somewhat resembling that
of vanilla. It has another good quality—it will keep for years, and
grows better with age. It may be used on all kinds of chocolate work
and candies, whether pulled or clear, giving them a thin, glossy film
which protects them from atmospheric moisture and thus prevents their
soon becoming sticky.


VIOLET CREAM MARSHMALLOWS.

  6 pounds of best A sugar,
  ½ pound of glucose,
  2 pints of water.

Cook to 238°; flavor floral extract of violet, violet color, 3 pounds
of marshmallows. Have a bright copper kettle, and put into it the 6
pounds of best A sugar and ½ pound of glucose; add to this 2 pints of
water; then set the kettle on a bright fire and cook to 238°; then pour
the batch on a clean slab, allowing it to remain until almost cold;
then with a steel paddle work the batch rapidly till it turns and sets
in a firm mass; now spread a damp cloth over the mass, leaving it for
thirty-five minutes; then knead the cream and put about 3 pounds in a
bon bon dipping-pot; now have about 3 pounds of marshmallows cut in
half with a pair of shears; now warm the cream in the dipping-pot and
flavor with floral extract of violet and color a deep violet color;
then dip the pieces of marshmallows in the cream and drop on waxed
paper, and continue till you have dipped all the marshmallows; and when
they are cold they are ready for use.


CREAM NOUGAT.

This is a delicious confection, if carefully made after the following
recipe:

  1¼ pounds of glucose,
  3¼ pounds of white sugar,
  1 pint of water,
  Whites of 6 eggs,
  1 pound of English walnut meats,
  3 pounds of Valencia almonds,
  Vanilla flavoring.

Whisk the whites of the eggs in a copper pan till they are light and
stiff; then put ¾ of a pound of the sugar in a small pan with ½ pint
of water and cook to 250°; pour the hot sugar into the beaten eggs, at
the same time beating the eggs to make them mix thoroughly with the
sugar; now put the remainder of the sugar into a copper pan together
with the glucose and ½ pint of water; cook to 260° and then remove from
the fire; stir in the sugar and glucose, and keep stirring until white
and creamy; add the eggs, slowly stirring them in, and lastly add the
almonds, walnut meats and vanilla flavoring. Now lay nougat wafers in a
frame on your marble and pour the nougat out on these, also placing the
wafers on the top and a board on top of the wafers. Let the batch lay
over night, and in the morning cut it into bars of required size.


CREAM SQUARES.

Put in kettle

  8 pounds sugar,
  2 pounds glucose,
  ½ gallon cream,
  ¼ pound butter.

Stir and cook to 250°; set off and pour in about 2 pounds fresh grated
cocoanut, stir until batch just starts to grain, then pour it on the
slab, between the iron bars, and let remain until it grains; then melt
4 pounds bon bon cream, same as for bon bons, pour it on the batch, and
spread it out evenly over same. When cold mark with caramel cutter and
cut into squares.


SALTED ALMONDS.

Heat 2 quarts of water to a boil, then pour 5 pounds almonds in the
water; let them remain a few minutes; try them by taking one out, and
if the skin or outside slips off pour them out at once in a sieve, then
pour cold water over them, and after you have taken off all the skins
lay them on a dry towel and let it absorb all the dampness out of them;
now put ½ pound of good butter in a clean kettle and set it over a slow
fire; when the butter is melted pour in the almonds and stir them until
they start to brown, then pour them out in a sieve and sprinkle fine
salt over them, then spread them out on a table to cool. Don’t get them
too brown when roasting, as they contain a good deal of heat when done
and will get too dark and partly burnt by doing so.


SALTED PEANUTS.

Place 1 pound of butter in a clean copper kettle over a slow fire;
when the butter is dissolved add 12 pounds Spanish shelled peanuts,
and stir them good until the peanuts get through popping and begin to
smoke and get nice and brown, then at once pour them out into a large
sieve and let the extra butter drop through; then pour them on the slab
or table and pour 1 pound fine salt over them, and mix them up and then
spread them out to cool.

If the above are roasted nicely you can work up a large trade on them,
as I have made and sold one hundred pounds per week in different places
where I have made them.


SALTED PECANS.

Melt ½ pound of butter in a clean copper kettle over a slow fire, then
pour in 5 pounds of pecans and stir good only one minute; then pour
them out quickly and finish same as Salted Almonds. Don’t let them
roast too long, as they turn black and are unfit to eat if they are
allowed to roast too much.


HOREHOUND ROLLS.

This piece of goods, when nicely made and put up in ten-cent rolls, can
be made a leader of in cold weather, as the public at large have great
confidence in the merits of horehound. Make a batch of horehound candy
as per recipe given in another part of this book, and after it has been
poured on slab divide it in two pieces; one piece pull on the hook
until it turns light brown color, then form it in a round piece; now
knead the other half, flatten it out around the pulled piece, place
it in front of the table furnace and pull it out in round sticks the
thickness of a broom handle; cut off in about eight-inch lengths.

These goods show up well when cut, and it is policy to flavor them
highly with horehound—make them double strength. Don’t wrap them, but
stack them up nicely in dishes or pans. Place a neat card upon them
stating “extra strong horehound rolls,” and it will add to their sale.


GINGER BON BONS.

Proceed the same as with Ginger Chocolate, only when rolling them out
don’t flatten them; color dipping cream a delicate yellow and dip
them and place on top of each one when dipped a little thin strip of
angelica.


JAP CHOCOLATES.

Make a batch of cocoanut Jap and pour it out on the slab and roll it
out in little oblong pieces, size of a pecan, and dip in chocolate, and
have helper sprinkle a little fine cocoanut on each piece as you dip
them.


FLAX SEED DROPS.

Place in kettle

  6 pounds sugar,
  2 pounds glucose,
  Water to dissolve same.

Cook to 280°; then pour in a small handful of flax seed and stir just a
moment, then pour on slab, color a delicate yellow and knead it good,
then form in shape as for stick candy, and then flatten it out and run
through lemon-drop rollers.

These goods look well, as the flax seed show up all through the drops.


HOREHOUND FLAX SEED SQUARES.

Make a batch of horehound candy as per horehound recipe, and just
before you pour out on slab, add the flax seed, then pour on slab and
cut as horehound squares.


NOUGAT SPONGE CHOCOLATE.

Place in kettle

  5 pounds sugar,
  5 pounds glucose,
  Water to dissolve.

Add 2 oz. nucoa butter.

Cook to hard ball, as for caramels, then add 1 quart cream, and stir
and cook again to hard ball; pour on slab, fold up edges; when cool
pull on hook, then lay it on the slab and chop up in coarse pieces 2
pounds of almonds and knead them into the batch; now flatten out the
batch between the iron bars and with rolling-pin flatten out nicely the
thickness of caramels; when cold cut in pieces one-fourth of an inch
wide and one and one-half inches long, and dip in chocolate.

The same batch with ground roasted peanuts in is fine and sells well,
and is called Peanut Nougat.


FRUIT JELLY CHOCOLATES.

Place 6 pounds of apricot pulp in kettle and the same weight of sugar,
and cook and stir until batch gets thick and drops off the paddle in
heavy drops; then set off on barrel and add ¼ ounce of powdered citric
acid and 2 ounces dissolved gelatin; then add 2 pounds roasted almonds
chopped fine; pour all in taffy pans lined with manilla paper, then
sift XXXX sugar over them and let them set for eight or ten hours, then
turn them out; take paper off and cut in pieces to suit, and dip in
chocolate.


SULPHUR DROPS.

Place in kettle

  6 pounds sugar,
  ¼ pound butter,
  1 pound glucose,
  Water to dissolve same.

Cook to 270°; then add 1 ounce of the best sulphur and flavor with
extract of lemon; pour on slab and knead it well, then form it in shape
and run it through lemon-drop rollers.


CREAM MINTS.

Place in kettle

  8 pounds sugar,
  1½ pounds glucose,
  Water to dissolve same.

Cook to 264°; pour on slab, then pour over the batch ¼ pound XXXX
sugar, knead up well, and pull on hook; flavor while pulling with oil
of peppermint; when well pulled place on spinning table, form as for
stick candy, and pull out as stick, and cut with shears in small pieces
size of a pecan; lay them in XXXX sugar; sift off the sugar and place
in pans.

These goods will grain and become soft and creamy.


CLOVE SQUARES.

Place in kettle

  7 pounds sugar,
  3 pounds glucose,
  Water to dissolve same.

Cook to 270° or 280°; and stir in a few drops of burnt sugar, flavor
with clove, and pour on slab; fold up the edges and knead the batch
good until it turns a nice brown color, then as quickly as possible
roll out thin and mark both ways with a caramel cutter; when cold break
apart.


YANKEE HONEY CARAMELS.

Place in kettle

  4 pounds sugar,
  4 pounds glucose,
  ½ gallon cream,
  1 oz. cocoa butter,
  2 oz. nucoa butter,
  1 pint strained honey.

Cook to a good, hard ball, not a crack; pour on slab; cool quick by
moving it in cold place on slab, then pull on hook until quite spongy;
when done flatten it out on slab the thickness of caramels; when cold
mark and finish as other caramels.


YANKEE NUT CARAMELS.

Proceed as with above, and when done pulling add 2 pounds nuts—knead
in any kind of nuts you wish—and roll between iron bars, thickness of
caramels.


CREAM FIGLETS.

Grind 5 pounds of figs and knead into it 2 pounds No. 1 dipping cream;
use XXXX sugar and get to a stiff paste; then with the rolling-pin
flatten it out the thickness of mint lozenges, and with a one-half-inch
round tin lozenge cutter cut them out and throw them in XXXX sugar;
when done sift off the sugar and stack them in dishes for the show case.

Grind dates, after removing the seeds, and proceed as with Cream
Figlets, and finish the same.

They are good eaters and sell well.

They can both be dipped in chocolate or dipping cream. They also make a
nice piece of goods in either one.


CHOCOLATE LAYER NOUGAT.

Make a batch of Vanilla Nougat, and as you place it in the box, when
finished, put in at first nougat enough to extend one inch in height,
then cover it with a wafer sheet, then spread over this dark melted
chocolate, and place another sheet of wafer paper over this; now pour
the balance of nougat on top and then another sheet of wafer paper.

When this nougat is cut the center shows up good and is a nice piece of
eating.

You can also, if you wish, make a pink or any other color of nougat and
place the chocolate in the same way. I usually run four or five kinds
of nougat in the above style, as it sets off the show case to good
advantage.

In dipping bon bons, chop up fine any kind of nuts and flatten them out
evenly on the table, and as you dip a bon bon, drop it on the nuts;
when dry stack them, with nut side up.

These goods look well. You can also color fine cocoanut pink, yellow or
violet, in fact any color to suit you, and drop bon bons as above. They
also look well.

To color cocoanut do so the same way as you would color sugar or sugar
sand, only omit the ammonia.


CREAM RAISINS.

Open very large raisins, take out the seeds and stuff them with dipping
cream, then crystalize them. They look well and are nice to top off
a box of candy with. Color some of the dipping cream violet, pink,
yellow, and leave some white. I always make them in assorted colors, as
they look better and sell better.


BUTTER-SCOTCH CHOCOLATES.

Make a batch of butter-scotch patties; run them small—a little larger
than a nickel—then dip them in chocolate.

They are leaders wherever they are made.

You can also dip the above in dipping cream; they make a nice piece of
goods. In my mind, anything that tastes well in our line sells well, no
matter if anyone else ever made the same piece of goods before or not.


CHOCOLATE-DIPPED CARAMELS.

It is not necessary to make chocolate caramels for dipping in
chocolate, as it is only a waste of chocolate. Make a plain vanilla
caramel, and when they are coated the coating itself will be all the
chocolate flavor needed.


CARAMEL CREAMS.

Make a nice caramel and cook it a little lower than for a stand up
caramel, and when cold cut in size of caramels, and then cut them in
two again and dip in dipping cream. They make a nice center if cut in
two and not cooked too high.


COCOA DATE CHOCOLATES.

Open any amount of dates and take out the seeds, and then place in them
fresh grated cocoanut; close them up, and when ready dip in chocolate.

These goods are good eaters and sell well.


GINGER CHOCOLATES.

Cut up in fine pieces ½ pound of ginger and knead it in 6 pounds of
No. 1 dipping cream to a stiff paste, then roll them out in little
balls, and then flatten them out with the forefinger; when done dip in
chocolate.


OPERA CREAM DATES.

Open 5 pounds dates and remove the seeds; now make a small batch of
Opera Cream as per recipe for same, knead it well, flavor slightly with
vanilla, roll in small pieces, and fill dates and finish as ordinary
cream dates.

These goods must be made in small batches in hot weather, as Opera
Cream soon sours. You will find these goods much richer than the
ordinary cream dates.


SPICED BON BONS.

Try these, as they are extra fine and cannot be duplicated by others
unless you give up the recipe.

Take two five-cent packages of New England mince meat and 5 pounds of
No. 1 dipping cream and knead them together, adding XXXX sugar until
you get it to a stiff paste, then roll out in little balls size of a
marble, and dip them in No. 1 dipping cream.


SPICED CHOCOLATES.

Proceed as with spiced bon bons, dip them in dark chocolate and place a
pecan half on top of each.

When dipped this is a beautiful piece of goods and sells well wherever
I have made it.


GINGER SQUARES.

Make same as Clove Squares, only flavor with ginger, and when on slab
color a delicate yellow, and finish as Clove Squares.


CHOCOLATE BOSTON CHIPS.

Put in kettle

  6 pounds sugar,
  1 pound glucose,
  Water to dissolve same.

Now get 1 pound of dark chocolate and melt it in front of table furnace
by placing it in an empty marshmallow box; when melted add XXXX sugar
and stir or knead it till quite a thick paste; now set to one side and
cook the above batch that you first prepared to 310°; pour off on slab,
prepare it for the hook and pull, then twist out the air and form it in
a flat piece on spinning table and lay the chocolate paste in center
and fold up quick, then flatten it out and see that the left end is
closed; now pull out one inch wide and thin as possible, and have your
helper crimp them, or leave them straight, or in curls, just as you
prefer.


COCOANUT CREAM CARAMELS.

Place in kettle

  6 pounds sugar,
  10 pounds glucose,
  Water to dissolve same.

Cook to 236°; set off on barrel and stir in all the fine powdered
cocoanut it will stand, then pour it on slab over heavy oiled paper,
and spread it out to about one-half inch in thickness; place iron bars
around it, then melt 8 pounds of fondant, not too hot, and spread
one-half of it over the top of the batch; let set a moment, then turn
over the whole batch carefully and take off the paper, then place iron
bars around again and spread the balance as before; when cold cut in
small squares. Now cook 10 pounds of sugar, and water to dissolve same,
to 238°; set off and with the paddle stir it just so as to partly
grain it, then dip the squares in this one at a time and lay them in a
wire screen or coarse sieve; when dry they are ready for the store.


HONEY CHOCOLATES.

Place in kettle

  10 pounds sugar,
  7 pounds honey,
  Water to dissolve same.

Cook to 244°; pour on a dampened slab, and when nearly cold pour on
the batch 2 pounds of ground pecans and cream in the usual way; now
melt the cream and add one-half glass of simple syrup and flavor with
extract of vanilla, and then run them in starch in prints in the shape
of patties; when cold dip them in dark coating of chocolate.


MARSHMALLOW FIGLETS.

Grind 5 pounds of figs, then take 2 pounds of marshmallows and mash
them up by tearing them apart, and knead them into the figs; add XXXX
sugar, and then pick them out and stack roll them up in balls size
of a marble; and then as you set them down press them flat with your
forefinger. When all is done lay them in XXXX sugar, and then pick them
out and stack them nicely in glass dish for show case.

These goods, cheap as they are to make, readily sell at forty cents per
pound, and are liked by all.


PLUM CHOCOLATES.

Take the stones out of two dozen good and ripe plums, and lay them
in a fine sieve and squeeze them through; now place the pulp in the
kettle and add 7 pounds of sugar and 1 pint of water; cook to 240° and
add quickly 2½ ounces of dissolved gelatin and stir and cook to 248°
or 250°; set off on barrel and run the batch into starch prints, oval
shape; when they set and are ready, dip in chocolate.

In winter when there are no plums, you can use any kind of can
preserves if you are unable to obtain plums.


CHOCOLATE FIGLETS.

Grind 5 pounds figs, and then add 2 pounds of fondant to it and knead
both well together; use XXXX sugar, and get it to a good stiff paste,
then flatten it out on the slab to about the thickness of caramels and
with a half inch tin lozenge cutter cut them out and dip in chocolate.

The above are also nice to dip in fondant, and look well made larger.
When dry cut in two so as to show the center.


SPUN SUGAR.

You may and you may not be able to make the above to look well the
first time you attempt it; but by practice, you will soon be able to
turn out quite a respectable batch. Cook any amount of sugar, and
water to dissolve it, to 276°, not above this, and see that you put
no more water in than is enough to dissolve the sugar, as boiling it
too long affects the color of the batch; use about one pint of water
to every 2 pounds of sugar; when the batch starts to boil cover the
kettle and let the steam wash the sides clean, then take off cover
and when the batch is cooked to 276° set kettle on a barrel; now have
ready two newspapers spread on the floor, and set a clean, empty sugar
barrel on the center of the paper and with a common egg whip, or four
or five kitchen forks tied together, dip into the batch and then swing
the forks or egg whip to and fro quickly as possible across the barrel;
continue this until the batch starts to darken; when at that point it
is unfit for use and must be added to what scraps you have; pick up the
spun sugar and form it as you wish.


MARSHMALLOW CHOCOLATE BRITTLE.

Take 4 pounds of fresh marshmallows and 2 pounds of dipping cream and
knead them together in front of the table furnace to a stiff paste; set
to one side, so as it will remain warm, and then place in kettle

  7 pounds sugar,
  2 pounds glucose,
  Water to dissolve.

Cook to 310°; then add ½ pint of dark molasses, and stir and cook to
320° or 330°; pour on slab when partly cold, fold up and pull on hook,
then twist out the air and place it on the spinning table and shape
it in a piece about ten by fourteen inches, and place the marshmallow
cream in the center the length of outside piece and fold it up as for
stick; then flatten it all out and pull in one inch strips as wide and
a little thicker than Boston chips, and have helper run the caramel
cutter over it; when cold dip in dark, sweet chocolate.


FOREST SWEETS.

Place in kettle

  5 pounds sugar,
  2 pounds glucose,
  Water to dissolve same.

Cook to 280° or 290°; then set kettle off on barrel and stir in all the
mixed shelled nuts you can possibly get in, then pour all in a coarse
sieve and let the drippings run through in a pan; now dump the batch on
a cold slab and with your fingers separate the nuts when cold; place
them in a long nickel pan for the store.

The nuts used are Brazils, almonds, walnuts, filberts and pecans.


OPERA CHOCOLATES.

Make a batch of Opera Cream and when done melt it as other fondant and
run in starch molds, such as a pointed common chocolate.

These goods, when well flavored with vanilla, are a leader.


SALT WATER SQUARES.

Place in kettle

  5 pounds sugar,
  2 pounds glucose,
  Water to dissolve same.

Cook to 270°; then add ¼ pound of butter, a teaspoonful of salt, stir
and cook to 280°; pour on slab, spread it with palette knife as thin as
possible; mark them with a caramel cutter at once, and when cold break
them apart.


VANILLA MARSHMALLOWS.

First dissolve 15 ounces gelatin in 3 quarts of hot water and set it
to one side; now place in kettle 15 pounds glucose, no water; stir
and cook to a hard ball, or about 248°; then set it off on barrel and
add 15 pounds XXXX sugar, then pour in the batch, through a strainer,
the 3 quarts of gelatin water, then pour the whole lot together and
flavor vanilla; now place in your marshmallow beater and beat until the
batch is good and stiff; pour it on slab; see that the slab is heavily
sprinkled with XXXX sugar, then with a palette knife spread it even
and sprinkle XXXX sugar over the top; let stand four or five hours,
then cut in squares size of all marshmallows; in cutting don’t draw the
knife, but press down and cut; have iron bars on slab before pouring
batch.

this book.


ALMOND CARAMELS.

Roast 5 pounds large almonds and set them to one side; then stick into
the end of each one the point of a good, sharp toothpick; the round
Chinese toothpicks are the best; when this is done cook a small batch
of caramel; when done, set the kettle off on a barrel and dip each one
of the roast almonds in it, then stick the end of the toothpick in the
hole of a fine sieve that must be turned upside down near your work;
continue this until all is finished, and when the caramel gets cold
pull out the toothpick and you will find it ready for use and a piece
of goods fine enough for the best retail stores. Don’t let toothpick
run through sieve; place it in sieve on an angle so that the caramel
won’t touch anything; then it is impossible to tell how they were
dipped.

In making a nice batch of Peanut Bar, it is best to blanch or husk the
peanuts. My way of doing this is to cook a batch of peanuts as for
Salted Peanuts, but omit the salt; when cold pour them in a sieve and
with the hands rub them until the husks are loosened, then blow them
all off; put on a batch as for Peanut Bar, only omit the peanuts, and
when the batch is about 280° or 290° set it off on a barrel and stir in
the nuts; then pour on the slab, flatten out nicely between iron bars;
when cold cut in bars to suit.

A CHEAP AND GOOD COCOANUT JAP.

Place in a kettle

  10 pounds glucose,
  2 pounds sugar,
  1 quart water.

Cook to 238°; set it off on barrel; now take a large wooden bowl, or
if you have none use a small sized washtub, and pour into it a pail of
water, then empty it out at once; this is done just to make the tub
damp; now place in the tub about 20 pounds fine powdered cocoanut, and
as your helper pours over it a dipperful of the batch just cooked, you
stir it in good with a paddle; continue this until you cannot possibly
stir in another pound, then pour it out on a slab and flatten it out
the height of your bars with a rolling-pin; let set one hour, and cut
to suit.

Another way to finish this is to flatten out two-thirds of the batch,
then color the other third a light pink and flatten it out over half
of the other batch then cut the third not covered and lay it over the
red, and when this is cut in slices it will leave the red center.

ready for use; now take

  3 pounds No. 1 dipping cream,

  1 pound English walnut pieces,

and knead it to stiff paste by using XXXX sugar; pick up little pieces
of this paste and lay in each date and close the date so as the cream
can be seen on one side; throw them in granulated sugar; sift off the
sugar, and they are ready for the store.

The above dates can also be dipped in No. 1 fondant and then cut in two
pieces, or dipped in chocolate and left whole; they eat well either way.


BURNT SUGAR OR CARAMEL COLOR.

Take any old saucepan and place in it 2 pounds sugar; now place it over
the fire, and when it starts to dissolve and smoke stir it with a spoon
or stick until all is a mass of black, melted and burnt sugar; set it
on the table and add and stir in a little water; don’t get it too thin;
and when cold pour in bottle for use.

paste; but as you have very little use for it the water is good enough
for retail shops.

Run in starch, oblong shape, 10 pounds fondant well flavored with
vanilla; then prepare 3 pounds chocolate, and when it is ready cut up
fine 1 pound of roasted almonds and stir them in the chocolate as you
use it and dip the centers.

This makes a nice outside coating if the nuts are chopped fine.


ROAST ALMOND CHOCOLATES.

Chop very coarse 5 pounds of roasted almonds, and dip them in
chocolate, by mixing all the nuts you can possibly stir in the
chocolate, and then with the fingers pick out a little at a time and
place on wax paper in size and shape of a pecan nut.


TO COOK SUGAR FOR CRYSTALIZING.

This all depends on how heavy a crystal you wish; and as there are no
two candy makers who work alike it will lay with you whether you like a
light crystal or a heavy one.

Place any amount of sugar you wish in kettle, and add plenty of water
to dissolve it; see that sides of kettle are clean, and cook by a syrup
gauge to 33½° for light, 34 or 35½° for heavy crystal.

Let crystal remain in the same kettle it is cooked in; don’t disturb it
until you wish to pour it over the goods you wish to crystalize, which
is cooked, before it is ready to use.

Experience alone will teach you on this point; nevertheless, if you
follow the above advice you will be able to crystalize goods in a
respectable manner.

paper in round cake shape, or lady finger shape, or any shape to suit
your taste; let stand until they set good, then turn the paper over and

in the kettle, with water to dissolve same, and cook to 238°; then set
off and pour in all the corn you can stir without spilling out any with

In dipping French cherries in chocolate, it is policy to dip them in
fondant first, as then after they are dipped in chocolate the acid
won’t eat through and cause the chocolate to become sticky.

  Water to dissolve same to 246°.

Pour off on a dampened slab, then pour over it the gratings of one
cocoanut, also the grated rinds of two oranges, and flavor with a
little oil of orange; when cold cream it in the usual way; let it stand
for one hour, then place all in a kettle and melt it over another
kettle with hot water in, so as the steam will melt it slowly; stir all
the time and color it orange; when melted pour it in taffy pans lined
with manilla paper; when cold cut in bars to sell at five cents each,

slab; when cool enough pull on hook until it gets nice and spongy, then
flatten it out on table and pull it out in strips about three inches
wide and cut in five-cent bars; wrap in wax paper; tie up each piece
with baby ribbon. This candy will grain soft and is delicious eating;
flavor while pulling, rose, vanilla or chocolate.

You can, if you wish, pull out the above in flat sticks one inch wide
and six inches long, and put them up in one-pound boxes, assorted
flavors and colors.


FIG PASTE CHOCOLATES.

Take 2 pounds of fig paste and 4 pounds of fondant and knead them
together good and stiff; then form little balls out of them, the size
of a marble, flatten them out with your finger as you lay them in
chocolate.

This center is fine and a great deal better eating than anything run in
starch.

You can also dip the above in No. 1 fondant.


CHOCOLATE ALMOND CLUSTERS.

Roast 5 pounds of almonds; when cold get chocolate ready for dipping;
take 1 pound of the almonds and place them in a taffy pan, then pour
over them chocolate enough to cover them, and then pick up six or eight
at a time and lay them in one heap on wax paper; continue this until
finished; then when they are dry cut in two in the center. The nuts
will then show and they make a nice piece of goods to top off a box.


VIOLET CHOCOLATES.

Melt any amount of No. 1 fondant over a very slow fire and stir good;
when dissolved set it off on a barrel and color a delicate color of
violet, then flavor violet and add 2 pounds glucose to every 10 pound
of fondant you have melted; stir in the glucose good, and run in small
oval starch prints; when they are ready to dip, dip them in dark
chocolate and sprinkle on each a little crushed violet.


MAPLE CREAM WALNUTS.

Dip English walnut halves in No. 1 fondant and have the fondant quite
thin by heating a little more than you would for nice dipping; then
after you are done, dip them in maple fondant. This makes a nice
combination and eats well.

If you use small walnut halves the above goods are also nice dipped in
chocolate.


PISTACHIO BON BONS.

Melt 10 pounds No. 1 fondant in kettle over steam and add to it ½ pound
pistachio nuts, chopped up very fine, color a light green, and flavor
with pistachio, then add 1 pound glucose; now run them in starch prints
in small-sized shapes; when they set and are ready to dip, dip them in
No. 1 fondant and place half a pistachio nut on top of each; let the
outside dipping cream remain white.


FILBERT BON BONS.

Chop up 2 pounds roasted filberts, after the husks have been blown
off; knead them into No. 1 fondant with XXXX sugar to a stiff paste.
Then roll them out in balls the size of marbles, dip in No. 1 fondant
and place on top of each half a filbert; flavor the dipping cream with
vanilla.

shells among them; now melt in bon bon kettle 6 pounds No. 1 fondant,
and when melted add the nuts; stir, and then with a teaspoon dish out
½ teaspoonful at a time and with the thumb slide them off on the slab;
when done crystalize them.

You can also dip the above in chocolate instead of crystalizing them,
and they make a good, rich center.


ICES FOR CRYSTALIZING.

Take 12 pounds No. 1 fondant and cut it in three parts of 4 pounds
each; now flavor one vanilla, one strawberry and color pink; the other
knead in a little dark chocolate, then work each piece into a stiff
cream by adding XXXX sugar; now roll out each piece to about eighteen
inches in length and set them together, then roll them round; cut up in
four pieces so as to handle easily, and roll them until you get a long
strip which is about as thick, or a little thicker, than stick candy;
now cut them in small pieces and set them side by side on the bottom of
a taffy pan; let them remain until a crust forms, so as to handle them,
then crystalize them in a syrup cooked to 33½°.

You can also make the above each color separate and cut them in flat or
square pieces, or you can work chopped nuts in them, or you can make
a batch with bottom cream; then have a layer of apricot jelly, then a
layer of cream on top.

These goods are nice for adding to mixed candy, and if you have good
taste you can make a dozen different patterns; some round, some square,
some diamond shape, etc.


SPICED DATES.

Cut open 5 pounds dates and remove the seeds; now take 3 pounds of
fondant and mix into it a five-cent package of New England mince meat;
knead it well to a stiff paste by adding XXXX sugar; now roll out in
little pieces the size of a marble and fill each date, and let the
open end show the cream as in common cream dates, then sand them in
granulated sugar.

The above goods can also be dipped in fondant or chocolate, and are a
fine piece of goods.

In dipping bon bons, you can sometimes use glycerine, by pouring a
little of it in the cream; it has a tendency to keep the bon bons a
little softer, and they will not become hard and dry as soon as without
the above.


HONEY NOUGAT.

Cook ½ gallon of strained honey and 4 pounds of XXXX sugar to a hard
ball, over a slow fire, then add and stir the whites of 12 eggs, well
beaten before adding them, then cook to a thin crack and set off on
barrel and add any amount of almonds to suit; pour in box lined with
wafer paper; cover top also with wafer paper; let remain until cold;
cut with a sharp knife.


OPERA CHERRY BON BONS.

Make a batch of Opera Cream, and then roll out pieces size of a marble
and press a French cherry into each piece; dip them in No. 1 fondant
and flavor the fondant a very little with wild cherry, and color it a
delicate pink.


FILBERT BRITTLE.

  Cook 4 pounds sugar,
  1 pound glucose,

1 pint water, to 250°; then add a tablespoonful of butter and about
the same of black strap molasses; stir and cook to 289°; set off on a
barrel; pour into it 1½ pounds of ground filberts; pour on the slab,
and with a palette knife spread it out as thin as you possibly can, the
thinner the better; turn batch over, and when cold break up and place
in pans.


BRITTLE CANDIES.

This class of candies are leading the bar goods, as they are more
delicate and are not so hard on the teeth, and by making black walnut,
Brazil nut, hickory nut, pecan and almond brittle the same as you would
filbert brittle, you will find a ready sale for them, if made in small
batches and fresh daily.


BUTTERCUPS.

  8 pounds sugar,
  1 pound glucose,
  Water to dissolve same.

Cook to 320°; pour on slab; when cold enough pull on hook and flavor to
suit; twist the air out and flatten it out on the spinning table, and
place the center in it and close the ends, form it in a round piece as
for stick candy and pull it out as stick and cut with buttercup cutter,
or run caramel cutter over it. While you are working on the above
batch have your helper get the center ready, so as when you take it
from hook it is ready for you; make the center of warm No. 1 fondant,
by placing the fondant in front of table furnace and adding a little
XXXX sugar in it; get it good and warm, as a cold center will cause the
outside to crack when pulling or cutting.

You can cook 2 pounds of glucose just to a boil, then set off on a
barrel, stir in ground nuts of any kind or ground figs to a stiff
paste. This is a good center and quickly made.

Every candy maker has his own way of making centers for buttercups, but
I find the above good enough, as they sell as good as any I know of. In
fact, buttercups and Boston chips are back numbers and out of date in
most parts of the country.

In making buttercups practice alone will teach you, as there are so
many kinds of centers, and outside wrappers, some with stripes, some
plain white; also others colored pink, violet, green; some with outside
not pulled, but clear; so you will find out that experience alone will
teach you to make a nice line of the above goods.


CINNAMON BON BONS.

Take 4 pounds of No. 1 fondant and knead into it ½ teaspoonful of
ground cinnamon, then pick up little pieces and roll them out the
size of marbles; when done dip them in No. 1 fondant and have helper
sprinkle on each bon bon just a little cinnamon as you dip them.


GINGER DROPS.

Place in kettle

  8 pounds sugar,
  2 pounds glucose,
  Water to dissolve same.

Cook to 230°; pour on slab; pour on batch ½ ounce of tartaric acid
and ½ ounce of extract of ginger; knead the batch good till all is
well worked in, then form it in shape and run through small lemon drop
rollers.

In running cream in starch prints for bon bons or chocolates, you will
find by adding a few drops of acetic acid to the cream just before
filling the impressions that it will have a tendency to make the
centers softer.

cutter and break or cut as caramels.

The above are nice dipped in fondant or chocolate.


BRAZIL CREAMS.

Select small Brazil nuts, and dip them in No. 1 fondant; flavor vanilla.

These goods eat well and are easily made.

Dip some in fondant and color the fondant a light pink and flavor
strawberry.


MAPLE COCOA CHOCOLATES.

Place in kettle

to imitate by others, as the above sugar gives it a rich and peculiar
flavor.

Cook to 310°; pour on slab; fold up at once, and cut off about 1 pound
and color it a dark red; set it where it will keep warm; now pull the
large piece good and white, and flavor peppermint while pulling; twist
air out and then flatten it out on the spinning table and form it in a
square piece; now roll out the red piece and cut it into four pieces,
flatten one of them wide, and place it on the white batch the length
of it, then place the other three pieces on as the first, in different
places, and then form the whole batch round; then take one end of it
and raise it up and pull up till you get it in shape of a long-necked
bottle, then lay batch down and pull out in stick size the length of
the table; have your helper twist one end while you help him on the
other; when done, keep rolling the sticks until cold, or they will
flatten on one side; cut with shears or stick candy chopper.


LEMON STICK.

Cook batch as for peppermint, only color the one pound yellow and pull
it on hook, and knead into the main piece 1½ ounces of tartaric acid,
and leave it clear; form it as for peppermint and top off with lemon
stripes, and finish as the peppermint batch.

In making stick candy canes, cut off the lengths you want on an angle,
and see that one end is a little smaller than the other; have helper
roll them until he sees they are getting cold, if he bends them too
soon the canes look flat and it affects the sale of them.


HOREHOUND STICK.

Proceed as for horehound squares, only run the caramel cutter over

Cook to 330°; pour on slab; when cool color light yellow and pull on
hook; now wrap this around the first batch and pull out the same as

fine eating piece, and you will find after your first batch it is a
trade winner.

work it up add the whites of 6 eggs well beaten, then work same as the
fondant. Then it is ready for casting in starch. Dip in milk chocolate
coating. This can be made in any flavor by adding the fruits or nuts
when you cast.


BUTTER CUP CHEWS.

Place in your kettle

  4 pounds granulated sugar,
  3 pounds glucose,
  1 pound butter,
  1 quart of sweet cream.

Cook to 264°. Set off of the fire and add 2 ounces of nucoa butter
and 3 sheets of gelatin that has been dissolved in a little warm
water. Pour on the slab, when cool pull on a hook. Color and flavor as
desired. Pull them out in front of your table furnace and cut on your
butter cup cutter.


DIPPED GRAPES.

For parties or receptions. These are fine for immediate use but will
not keep over 24 hours.

Take some solid Malaga grapes, cut them close to the stem (be sure not
to break the skin of the grape), dip them in fondant, flavor and color
to suit.


DIPPED ORANGE SLICES.

Take some solid Tangerine oranges, break them up in sections, be
careful not to break the skin, dip in plain dipping fondant so the
orange color will show through. This is a very handsome confection, but
like the grapes, will not keep but a short time.


HINTS ON BUYING SUPPLIES.

My experience has demonstrated that in nine cases out of ten it pays to
buy the best of material for your candy factory, your soda fountain or
your ice cream.

In soliciting the advertisements of supply houses for this book, I have
only asked those whom I know and whose goods I have used. You will find
any material you get from them to be of the best quality.


LONDON CONFECTIONERY.

Comment on This Book.

Rigby’s Reliable Candy Teacher.—There is a considerable call amongst
workers in this country for reliable recipe books in connection with
the confectionery trade. There is such a constant change taking place
in the methods of manufacture, and so rapid is the introduction of
new lines and variations of old lines, that it is a difficulty with a
number of workers to keep up with them. A number of these improvements
and novelties come from America, and whatever may be the opinions of
manufacturers on the opposition which they may meet in business from
American manufacturers, there are no two opinions upon the alacrity
with which the Yankee notions are seized and adapted to the business
in this country. A number will therefore welcome the appearance of a
practical and reliable guide on confectionery, which has been published
by Mr. W. O. Rigby, and which is known as “Rigby’s Reliable Candy
Teacher,” and contains over 500 recipes for the manufacture of popular
confections and summer drinks. There is one thing always to be admired
about the American works in connection with trade recipes; they do not
elaborate for the mere purpose of extending the book, the directions
are given in a plain and straightforward fashion, and this work is no
exception to the rule. Whilst Mr. Rigby characterises his book as a
“humble little work,” he at the same time takes pains to state that it
contains twenty years’ experience in the leading cities of the United
States, an experience which he is prepared to place at the disposal of
the readers. He lays claim to having published in it the largest number
of creditable recipes for making candy ever presented in a single work.
The first portion of the work is taken up with a few general hints in
regard to the business. Then chocolates, moulds, fondants, caramels,
opera creams, taffy, cocoanut goods, French nougat, and all kinds of
novelties are treated. The book is well printed in large type, with
paper covers.




Soda Formulas

[Illustration]


THE SODA FOUNTAIN.

Your soda fountain, and everything attached to the fountain, should be
above suspicion as to cleanliness. Your counter top, glasses, crushed
fruit jars, spoons, etc., should be perfectly clean.

Add a small amount of common soda or some of the well-known washing
powders to a bucket of water and keep under your counter to wash your
ice cream soda glasses in, afterwards rinsing them.

Don’t hire a cheap boy to run your fountain; a boy may be cheaper than
a man, but people have confidence in a man that a boy cannot inspire.

Use all the ice possible; it don’t pay to skimp on ice.

Every morning wash all your glasses and all of the fountain fixtures
with good soapsuds.

Always serve cream with all the syrups that you can; never ask a
customer if he wants cream; give it to him whether he asks for it or
not. Of course, use some judgment; don’t serve cream with lemon ginger
ale, and such syrups.

Always keep a gallon or half-gallon bottle of each kind of syrup in
your reserve stock. This should be labeled and kept in your cellar or
some cool place.

Fruit juices cost more than extracts, but it pays to use them in your
soda water. Use a fruit juice such as you will find advertised in the
rear of this book and your customers will come again.

If a customer breaks a glass don’t accept pay for it; look pleasant; it
was an accident.

Have stools in front of your fountain counter; but you must be careful
lest you have loafers.

It is a good idea to have two or three tables, or as many more as is
necessary, to accommodate your trade, and chairs for them, to serve ice
cream soda. This is popular with ladies.

Always serve a small glass of ice water with your ice cream soda.

If it is possible, make your own ice cream; then you avoid getting good
ice cream one day and poor the next. If you want something very fine
for fountain trade, use our formula No. 1.

Don’t sell ice cream soda for five cents just because your competitor
does; give them something good and charge them ten cents; you will find
your customers will be willing to pay that if you give them good soda.
Always keep a good line of crushed fruits; do not use preserves. Get
your crushed fruits from some good reliable house that makes this a
business. See advertisement in rear of book.

Have your fountain clerk dressed in white coat and apron; never allow
him to wear soiled linen.

Do not cover your fountain top to prevent it from getting dirty; it
takes but little time to wash it, and it is too fine a fixture to hide
by covering it up.

Have your silver polished frequently; it gives your fountain the
appearance of cleanliness.

Egg drinks can be made very popular and profitable by exercising care
in their mixture.

Be liberal in your soda advertising, as it is the best paying part of
your store during summer seasons, if properly attended to.

  1 ounce of citric acid solution.

In using this syrup, use two ounces to a glass; draw same as ginger
ale; add a teaspoonful of powdered sugar.


GINGER SYRUP.

This syrup can only be made by confectioners, as the expense is too
great to those who cannot use the ginger later for other purposes.

Buy a half barrel or keg of Canton ginger. Strain the syrup off of it
and put in separate vessel and it is ready for use; then fill your keg
of Canton ginger with simple syrup; let stand until the other is used
up, or after standing two weeks it is ready for use again; this can be
repeated several times.

Canton ginger may be procured of any of the supply houses advertised in
this book.

  1 quart strawberry syrup,
  1 quart vanilla syrup,

  8 ounces soap bark chips.

Place them in 1 gallon of boiling water, let stand for three hours,
then place 3 ounces gum arabic in this; let it stand for 48 hours;
strain through fine sieve, and it is ready for use. Use about ¼ ounces
of this foam to a gallon of syrup.


SIMPLE SYRUP.

  30 pounds granulated sugar,
  3 gallons water.

EXTRACTS.

We give you a few formulas for the manufacture of extracts, but we
advise you to buy them of some reliable house that makes this a
business. See advertisement in rear of book:

1. Extract of Aniseed—Aniseed, ground, twelve ounces; alcohol, five
pounds.

2. Angelica—Angelica root, twelve ounces; alcohol, five pounds.

3. Basilicum—Leaves of basilicum, three pounds; alcohol, five pounds.

4. Bergamot—Bergamot rind, one pound four ounces; alcohol, five pounds.

5. Extract of Calamus—Calamus root, one pound; alcohol, five pounds.

6. Lemon Extract—The rind of sixty fresh lemons; alcohol, five pounds.

7. Orange—Orange peelings, fresh, two pounds; alcohol, five pounds.

Great care should be taken when peeling these fruits, so as not to
cut the inner white skin, but only the yellow part, because the white
of both the lemon and the orange has a bitter taste and will, when
introduced into the extract, spoil the fine flavoring quality of these
fruits.

8. Nutmeg—Ground nutmeg, twelve ounces; alcohol, five pounds.

9. Cloves—Whole cloves, twelve ounces; alcohol, five pounds.

10. Extract of Peppermint—The fresh leaves of peppermint, two pounds;
alcohol, two pounds.

11. Roses—One pound of fresh salted leaves of roses; alcohol, five
pounds.

12. Sage—Fresh leaves of sage, three pounds; alcohol, five pounds.

13. Celery Extract—Celery seeds, mashed, three ounces; alcohol, five
pounds.

14. Coffee Extract—Good coffee roasted and ground into a coarse powder,
two pounds; alcohol, five pound.

15. Caraway—Caraway seeds, one pound; alcohol, five pounds.

16. Cacao—One pound of ground cacao, previously freed from grease;
alcohol, five pounds.

17. Tonka Beans—Tonka beans, pounded, one pound; alcohol, five pounds.

18. Vanilla—Vanilla beans, cut into small pieces, eight ounces;
alcohol, five pounds.

19. Violet Extract—Orris root, powdered, one pound; alcohol, five
pounds.

20. Cinnamon—Ceylon cinnamon, whole, one pound; alcohol, five pounds.

21. Bitter Almonds—Oil of bitter almonds, six ounces; alcohol, five
pounds.


CARBONATED WATERS.

My advice, especially to the smaller dealers, is to have some reliable
bottling company make your carbonated waters; but if you use a great
deal of it, and are situated so that you can carbonate your own waters,
use the carbonic acid gas cylinders. One of the cylinders will charge
from 80 to 100 gallons of water. This will make your founts cost you
about twenty-five cents for ten gallons.


THE WAY TO DRAW ICE CREAM SODA.

First place your ice cream in your glass, then your crushed fruits, then
turn on fine soda stream until glass is filled. This makes the finest
ice cream soda it is possible to make. My mode of drawing is entirely
different from any other soda experts.


MAKING SOLID DRINKS.

In drawing solid drinks put the syrup in first, then use an eight-ounce
mineral glass to draw your plain soda in. Add your phosphate to your
syrup if required, and mix by throwing from one glass to the other.

Never use shaved ice in soda water, as it spoils your soda and makes it
flat tasting. Shaved ice should be used for no other purpose at a soda
fountain but for the manufacture of glaces. In making egg drinks don’t
use shaved ice, but cracked ice, small lumps, as this breaks your egg
up and is strictly necessary in this mixture.


GLACES.

Glaces are made by shaving ice in an ice shaver into small glass mugs.
After you have filled your glass mug with crushed ice, use a long soda
spoon to make a hole in the middle of the ice; fill this with crushed
fruit, or any flavor that you like, shave a little more ice on top, and
it is ready for the customer.

This is a very profitable drink and the most popular flavors are
cherry, strawberry, orange, peach, raspberry, pineapple, plum, apricot
and claret.


CITRIC ACID SOLUTION.

Put 5 pounds of crushed citric acid and 1 pint of water into a
galvanized iron kettle and bring to gentle boil, constantly stirring,
immediately filtering through paper into gallon bottle; add enough warm
water to fill bottle; keep well corked.


RED COLOR FOR SODA SYRUPS.

Take 1 ounce of No. 40 carmine and add 4 ounces of alcohol; let stand
for a short time and be very careful in using it, as it is very strong
and necessitates only a few drops to a gallon of syrup.


HOT SODA.

In making hot soda, it is not necessary to use carbonated water. Get a
coffee urn—a fancy nickel plated one—and keep hot water in it all the
time. Use great care in keeping this urn cleaned out. Hot soda has not
been as thoroughly advertised by the soda fountain people throughout
the United States as it should have been. I find hot soda business
very profitable if properly conducted. Use small, thin china cups and
saucers. I prefer the plain instead of the decorated, as they look much
cleaner and neater. Most of the extracts used in making hot drinks are
prepared, but I shall give you a few that I manufacture myself and find
them to give better satisfaction and are cheaper than those I can buy.

Salt, pepper, nutmeg and celery salt, are four articles that should be
kept in small salt cellars to set on your soda counter. Don’t use ice
cream soda spoons, but get a dozen small-sized teaspoons. Have cream
pitcher and sugar bowl to match your cups.


HOT LEMON SYRUP.

  1 gallon simple syrup,
  4 oz. lemon extract,
  2 oz. citric acid solution.


HOT GINGER SYRUP.

  1 gallon simple syrup,
  3 oz. ginger ale extract,
  ½  oz. citric acid solution.


HOT BEEF TEA.

Put ½ teaspoonful of beef extract into a cup, turn hot water into it,
stir well, adding salt and pepper to suit.

Use very little pepper.


HOT CLAM SODA.

Use 1 tablespoonful of clam juice, a little sweet milk, then add your
hot water; stir with a spoon and add salt and pepper.


HOT CELERY BEEF.

Make same as beef tea, except add, quite liberally, your celery salt.


HOT MALTED MILK.

One teaspoonful of malted milk, then add hot water; stir well, then
salt and pepper.


HOT CHOCOLATE.

Use about 1 ounce of chocolate syrup No. 2; about 3 ounces milk; fill
mug with hot soda and add a spoonful of rich cream.


HOT COCOA.

Place one teaspoonful of powered cocoa in cup, then one ounce of milk,
then two or three lumps of sugar, then slowly fill the mug with hot
soda, constantly stirring.

Great care should be used in making this, as the cocoa lumps if you are
not very careful.


PERSIAN SHERBET.

Place in one phosphate bottle 1 pint of alcohol and 1 pint of oil of
orange, sweet; color this pink; now fill another phosphate bottle with
citric acid solution.

This can be served with any syrup, but the most popular are such as
phosphates, lemon, orange, cherry, grape, raspberry.

Draw 2 ounces of your syrup, then fill half full of cracked ice and a
couple of dashes out of each bottle. Serve same as phosphate, in small
eight-ounce mineral glasses.


CREAM FRAPPE.

This is a very popular and profitable drink and a ten-gallon fount full
of frappe will net you $38.70 and cost you $1.60 to make it.

First dissolve 8 ounces of Coxe’s gelatin in ½ gallon of hot water; now
filter 7 gallons of cold water into a ten-gallon fount; add 1½ gallons
of simple syrup and 8 ounces of vanilla extract; now strain the gelatin
water into a dishpan and color a blood red; add it to the balance in
ten-gallon fount and charge to 160° solid. After the fount is charged
the blood red will turn into a delicate pink and the vanilla kills the
taste of the gelatin.


ABOUT SUNDAES.

This has become one of the most popular dishes served at the soda
fountain. The one thing that should be first in your mind is the
service used. Your champagne glasses, or your Sundae cups should be
either silver, glass or china, but always thin and dainty in design. A
special spoon smaller in size than your soda spoons and a small silver
tray should be used.


MERRY WIDOW SUNDAE.

Put one disher of Ice Cream in a Champagne glass, then cover with
crushed cherries, place nuts on crushed cherries, then crushed
pineapple on nuts; place five cherries around edge of glass and one on
top. This is a big hit of the large cities.


TANGERINE SUNDAE.

Take a Tangerine orange cut in half, remove the fruit. Care should be
taken not to break the skin. Fill the half with vanilla ice cream, now
pour on a ladle of crushed orange over the cream. Cut some long narrow
strips of the orange peel, about 4 of them and place them on ice cream,
running up and down.


PUFFED RICE SUNDAE.

Place a small disher of vanilla ice cream in a champagne glass;
sprinkle a small amount of puffed rice over and around the ice cream
then a few ground nuts. Top with a cherry.


CASSIA SUNDAE.

Place a small disher of caramel ice cream in a champagne glass,
sprinkle shredded cocoanut over this, then a small amount of ground
cinnamon over this.


MARSHMALLOW SUNDAE.

Place a small disher of vanilla ice cream in a champagne glass, cut
some marshmallows in halves; place a row around your ice cream; pour a
ladle of strawberry stock over the ice cream; now place a marshmallow
on top and a cherry on the marshmallow.


CANTELOUPE SUNDAE.

Take a nice cold ripe canteloupe, cut in half, clean the seeds out;
place a disher of vanilla ice cream in the canteloupe; pour a ladle of
ground nuts over the ice cream; top with crystalized violet.


ORIENTAL FRUIT SUNDAE.

Place in Champagne glass, small spoonful of ground Lichee nuts, then
disher of vanilla ice cream; place ground figs ½ way round the ice
cream, then ground dates the other half; then place small pieces of
figs and dates cut up on the ice cream. Top with cherry.


RAINBOW SUNDAE.

Place in a champagne glass, half a disher of strawberry ice cream; ½
disher of vanilla ice cream; half a ladle of crushed pineapple on one
side, half a ladle of cherries on the other. Top with crystalized mint
leaf.


CHERRY SUNDAE.

Place a disher of ice cream in your glass or cup; then a good, big
ladle of whole cherries mixed with some syrup; have a few extra large
Maraschino cherries under your counter and place one of these on top of
your ice cream.


MAPLE NUT SUNDAE.

Place a disher of vanilla ice cream in your sundae cup or glass; now
pour about one ounce of maple syrup over the ice cream, then sprinkle
about one tablespoonful of chopped nuts over this.


STRAWBERRY SUNDAE.

Place a disher of ice cream in your sundae cup or glass, then have some
nice ripe strawberries crushed, mixed with syrup and powdered sugar;
then place 2 or 3 whole strawberries on top of this.


PLAIN SYRUP SUNDAES.

Sundaes can be made with any syrup, or flavors used at the soda
fountain. Simply use the plain ice cream and pour your flavor desired
over it. The same rule applies to nut sundaes. Some fountains carry
four or five different kinds of ground nuts, but I do not think this is
necessary, as it is very hard when the mixture is made to distinguish
the kind of nut used. The main thing is to be sure the nuts are
absolutely fresh, and not rancid.


HOW TO USE CREAM FRAPPE.

Serve with any flavor. In drawing syrup for frappe use 1½ ounces on the
glass. For instance:


CHOCOLATE FRAPPE.

Draw 1½ ounces of chocolate syrup in soda glass; now fill glass
one-third full of frappe; then fill balance of glass with heavy soda
stream; now pour from one glass to the other, then turn just a little
frappe on top, and you have one of the most inviting drinks imaginable.

Twenty different drinks can be made from this recipe.


FRAPPE FOR EGG DRINKS.

First draw your syrup, 1½ ounces to the glass; add your egg and cracked
ice, then shake in shaker, then add one-third of an eight-ounce mineral
glass full frappe, throwing from one glass to the other, then draw just
a little frappe on top and sprinkle with ground nutmeg.


FRAPPE WITH ICE CREAM SODA.

After you have your ice cream soda ready to serve, but not quite filled
to the top, fill glass up with frappe. This is especially popular with
ladies.


NOTICE.

In giving you recipes in all these sherbets I have made the amount of
sugar the same.

Now, in a great many sherbets it is necessary to use more sugar than
others. The amount to be used in each one can be ascertained only by
one’s own taste. Taste your sherbet as you prepare it. When you have it
the sweetness desired, then it ought to be satisfactory. In the amount
of fruit used it is not strictly necessary to follow my directions as
to the amount used in all these recipes, but make them stronger or
weaker, as you like. I simply give these proportions, such as I find
give the best satisfaction.


BANANA SHERBET.

  3 quarts water,
  6 pounds XXXX sugar,
  About 15 very ripe bananas,
  White of one egg.

Press them through a fine sieve into your sugar and water, then add
1 ounce of citric acid solution; strain all through a sieve into the
freezer, and freeze.


No. 1. CURRANT SHERBET.

  3 quarts water,
  6 pounds XXXX sugar,
  3 quarts of ripe red currants,
  White of 1 egg.

Press them through a fine sieve; add them to your sugar and water, with
1 ounce of citric acid solution; strain into freezer, and freeze.


No. 2. CURRANT SHERBET.

Mash 2 quarts red currants and 1 quart of red raspberries, add 6 pints
rock candy syrup; place on fire, bring to gentle boil, then add the
juice of 2 lemons and strain through fine sieve; then add whites of 2
eggs, and freeze.


No. 1. STRAWBERRY SHERBET.

  3 quarts water,
  6 pounds XXXX sugar,
  1 ounce citric acid,
  3 quarts large, ripe strawberries,
  White of 1 egg.

Press the berries through a fine sieve, add them to your sugar and
water, and strain all through a fine sieve into your freezer.


No. 2. STRAWBERRY SHERBET.

Proceed same as above, only when preparing berries simply crush them
up well and put in whole. This mode is used quite extensively in some
parts of the country, but I prefer the first recipe, because the
berries being put in whole causes them to freeze in lumps.


PEACH SHERBET.

  3 quarts water,
  6 pounds powdered sugar,
  White of 1 egg.

Take 2 dozen peaches; they must be very ripe; remove the seeds and
press them through a fine hair sieve, then add 1 ounce of citric acid
solution; strain through a sieve into your freezer, then freeze.

In making peach sherbet crack about 6 of the stones and mash them in a
glass with a little water. Add this to your batch, and it will make a
great improvement in the flavor.


BLACKBERRY SHERBET.

  3 quarts water,
  6 pounds XXXX sugar,
  1 ounce citric acid solution,
  White of 1 egg,
  3 quarts very ripe blackberries.

Press them through a fine sieve into your sugar and water, then strain
all through a sieve, and freeze.


APRICOT SHERBET.

  3 quarts water,
  6 pounds XXXX sugar,
  White of 1 egg.

Take 2 dozen apricots; they must be very ripe; remove the seeds and
press them through a fine hair sieve, then add 1 ounce of citric acid
solution; strain through a sieve into your freezer, then freeze.


PLUM SHERBET.

  3 quarts water,
  6 pounds powdered sugar,
  White of 1 egg.

About 2 quarts very ripe wild goose plum, or any other variety that
is not too flat tasting. I prefer the wild goose plum, as it produces
a better flavor than most others. Remove the seeds and press them
through a fine sieve and add 1 ounce of citric acid solution; strain
all through sieve into your freezer, and freeze.


RASPBERRY SHERBET.

  3 quarts water,
  6 pounds XXXX sugar.

Take 3 quarts of fresh, ripe raspberries; don’t use red raspberries, as
they are too flat-tasted; use the black ones; press them through a fine
hair sieve, then add this to your sugar and water; then add white of 1
egg, and strain all through a sieve into your freezer, and freeze.


No. 1. ORANGE SHERBET.

Take 3 quarts of water, add 6 pounds powdered sugar, boil for twenty
minutes; remove from fire, add the juice of 40 oranges; let cool;
strain, and add the whites of 3 eggs.


No. 2. ORANGE SHERBET.

Squeeze out juice of 20 oranges and 12 lemons; add 6 pints rock candy
syrup, ½ ounce citric acid and whites of 2 eggs; also grate the rinds
of 3 oranges and color a delicate orange color, then freeze.


LEMON SHERBET.

Take 6 pints of water, 6 pounds sugar; boil for twenty minutes; add the
juice of 20 lemons; let cool; strain, and add the whites of 3 eggs;
then freeze.


PINEAPPLE SHERBET.

  3 quarts water,
  6 pounds XXXX sugar,
  6 pineapples, cut up fine,
  White of 1 egg.

Press through a fine hair sieve; add 1 ounce of citric acid solution;
strain into freezer, and freeze.

Canned pineapple can be used instead of fresh pineapple. Use two cans
of grated instead of the 6 whole ones.


POINTERS ON FREEZING.

In all my recipes for making ice creams I tell you to strain your
cream and sugar through a fine sieve. I do this as a precaution, thus
avoiding flies and other small foreign particles being in your cream
after it is frozen. Care should be exercised in turning your freezer.
Start slowly and at the finish turn very rapidly. By turning slowly
at the start it avoids the producing of butter on the dasher, and by
turning rapidly at the finish it swells your cream. I think it a good
idea after you are through freezing to wash the top of your freezer off
good before removing; it thus avoids small particles of salt falling in
your cream.


POINTERS ON RE-PACKING ICE CREAM.

When you re-pack your cream, if it is soft take your long wooden ice
cream paddle and work it up and down, mixing your ice cream thoroughly,
then pack it with an extra lot of salt with your ice. This is
especially necessary after cream has stood a couple of days. In packing
ice cream I think it is strictly necessary to use porcelain lined cans,
as it will not do to pack ice cream and let it stand in a tin can more
than one day.


ICE CREAM.

Vanilla.

This recipe is for pure cream, and I consider it the finest of my
recipes, being very simple.

To each gallon of cream use 1¾ pounds of XXXX powdered sugar. To each
gallon of cream use 1 ounce of vanilla.


ICE CREAM.

Vanilla.

Two gallons milk boiled quickly, stirring constantly; take off the fire
and stir in 5 pounds of sugar and ½ gallon condensed milk, then strain
through cloth and let cool. When cool add 3½ gallons of cream and 4
ounces of vanilla extract, and freeze.


NEW YORK ICE CREAM.

Three gallons of cream, 3¼ pounds of powdered sugar, the whites and
yolks of 21 eggs; beat them up good, add them to your sugar and cream,
and it is ready to freeze. This makes a very rich yellow cream.


ICE CREAM.

Vanilla.

This recipe is given for a very cheap article of ice cream. Take 1
quart of milk, add 1½ ounces of gelatin. This gelatin must be dissolved
in 1 pint of hot water before using; then dissolve 1¼ pounds of sugar
in 3 quarts of cold milk; strain this into freezer, add 1 ounce vanilla
extract, then stir briskly for a minute; then it is ready for the
freezer.


VANILLA ICE CREAM.

First beat 18 eggs, whites and yolks, then add

  2½ pounds of powdered sugar,
  2 gallons fresh milk,
  3 ounces vanilla extract.

This makes a good ice cream and a very cheap one.


STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM.

  1 gallon cream,
  1¾ pounds XXXX sugar,
  3 quarts fresh strawberries.

Press them through a fine hair sieve, mix this with your sugar and
cream and strain all through a fine sieve into the freezer, and freeze.


PEACH ICE CREAM.

  1 gallon cream,
  1¾ pounds XXXX powdered sugar.

Take 15 large, ripe peaches—it is necessary that they be dead
ripe—remove the seeds and press them through a fine hair sieve; add
them to your sugar and cream, then strain all through a fine sieve into
your freezer, then it is ready to freeze.


ORANGE ICE CREAM.

  1 gallon cream,
  1¾ pounds XXXX sugar.

Take 6 ripe oranges, grate the peel, then press the oranges and peel
through a fine hair sieve; mix with sugar and cream and strain all
through a fine sieve; then add a few drops of oil of orange, and it is
ready to freeze.


LEMON ICE CREAM.

  1 gallon cream,
  1¾ pounds XXXX sugar.

Then grate four lemons and press lemons and gratings through a sieve
into your sugar and cream; add a few drops of oil of lemon, color a
delicate yellow, then strain all through a fine hair sieve, and it is
ready to freeze.


HOKEY POKEY ICE CREAM.

Dissolve 5 ounces corn starch in 2 gallons of milk; add 4 pounds sugar;
set on a slow fire until it boils so it thickens; take from the fire;
add

  5 ounces vanilla extract,
  ½ gallon cream,
  Whites of 12 eggs,
  2 ounces gelatin.

Dissolve in hot water; stir it up well and strain through a fine hair
sieve; let it stand until it gets cool, then freeze, then put in molds
and pack in tub of ice; let it stand one or two hours, then cut in
slices and wrap in wax paper.

This will stand lots of exposure before it will melt.


TUTTI FRUTTI ICE CREAM.

  1 gallon cream,
  1½ pounds sugar.

Cut up very fine ¾ pound of French cherries and pineapple; let them
soak in brandy a short time, then add to the cream and sugar, and
freeze. Soaking the fruits in brandy improves them in flavor and keeps
them from freezing in hard lumps.


CURRANT ICE CREAM.

  1 gallon cream,
  2 pounds XXXX sugar,
  3 pints fresh, ripe currants.

Press them through a fine hair sieve; either color a delicate pink or
let it remain white so the currants will show in the cream.

It is necessary to use more sugar in making this cream because the
currants being sour it must have more sweetness to offset the acid in
the fruit.


PLUM ICE CREAM.

  1 gallon cream,
  1¾ pounds XXXX sugar.

Take 8 ounces crushed fruit, or 3 pints very ripe wild goose plum;
press through a fine sieve. Do not color, as I think it looks much
better with that creamy look the plums produce.


CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM.

  1 gallon cream,
  1¼ pounds XXXX sugar,
  8 ounces extra heavy chocolate syrup.

Stir all together well and strain through a fine sieve; then it is
ready to freeze.


PISTACHIO ICE CREAM.

  1 gallon cream,
  1¾ pounds XXXX sugar.

Strain through a fine sieve, then add ¼ pound pistachio nuts, ground
very fine, and a little pistachio extract; you can add a little green
color or leave it white so the green nuts will show in it; then it is
ready to freeze.


VIOLET ICE CREAM.

  1 gallon cream,
  1¾ pounds XXXX sugar.

Strain through a fine sieve, then add a little violet color and violet
extract; then it is ready to freeze.

This makes a very pretty cream for receptions or very fine trade.


NUT ICE CREAM.

Six different kinds of Ice Cream can be made after this recipe. They are

English Walnut, Filbert, Almond, Pecan, Brazil, Hickory.

And still only having one kind of ice cream vanilla in stock.

Grind about 1 pound of each kind of the above nuts, keep them in small
tin boxes where you dish your ice cream; first fill your disher, or
measure, half full of cream, then put a big teaspoonful of the ground
nuts into the disher, then fill up with ice cream.

When you turn it out into the dish sprinkle a few nuts over the top and
it is ready to serve.

I have worked this scheme at the leading summer resorts of Minnesota
and a number of places in Florida.

Your competitor will hear you are running so many different kinds of
ice cream, and if he don’t know how to make nut cream this way he will
mix the ground nuts in with his cream and freeze each kind separately,
making it necessary to carry a much larger stock than you do.


RASPBERRY ICE CREAM.

  1 gallon cream,
  1¾ pounds XXXX sugar.

Take 3 quarts fresh, ripe raspberries, press them through a fine hair
sieve into your cream and sugar, then strain all through a fine sieve,
then it is ready to freeze.


BANANA ICE CREAM.

  1 gallon cream,
  1¾ pounds XXXX sugar.

Take 12 very ripe bananas, press them through a fine hair sieve into
your cream and sugar, then strain all through a fine sieve, and it is
ready to freeze.


BLACKBERRY ICE CREAM.

  1 gallon cream,
  1¾ pounds XXXX sugar.

Take 3 quarts very ripe blackberries, press them through a fine sieve
into your sugar and cream, then strain all through a fine sieve into
the freezer, and freeze.


FANCY NUT ICE CREAM.

  24 eggs,
  5 pounds sugar.

Beat well together, then add one gallon of sweet cream and 2 quarts of
milk. Cook to a good scald, then add one more gallon of cream. When
cool flavor vanilla and freeze. When frozen add 1½ pounds of chopped
nut meats; any kind desired. Stir them in thoroughly before you pack
your cream.


BISQUE ICE CREAM.

To 1 gallon of vanilla ice cream stir in 8 ounces of crushed, dry
almond macaroons.


COFFEE ICE CREAM.

  To 1 gallon of cream,
  1 pound of sugar,
  3 ounces good ground coffee, and
  8 egg yolks.

Place the sugar and coffee and half the cream on a slow fire and stir
until it comes to a boil, then mix the yolks with the remaining cream;
stir all together and bring to a boiling point. Then strain through a
fine sieve. When cool freeze.


CARAMEL ICE CREAM.

Place 1½ pounds of granulated sugar in copper kettle and melt slowly
without water. When a good brown, slowly stir in one gallon of sweet
cream, set off and add 4 pounds of granulated sugar and 2 gallons of
cream. Flavor with 2 ounces of vanilla. When cool freeze.


FROZEN FRUITS.

The fruits used in this recipe should be soaked for at least 4 hours in
brandy.

  2 pounds of brandied fruit,
  2 quarts of water,
  2 pounds sugar,
  Whites of 2 eggs.

Mix well together and then freeze.


NORMONA PUNCH.

  3 quarts of peach juice,
  1 quarts of orange juice,
  4 pounds of sugar.

Mix well by stirring, then freeze.


WATER SOUFFLES.

  3 dozen eggs, whites and yolks,
  3 quarts of fruit juice, (any kind desired)
  6 pounds granulated sugar,
  3 quarts of water.

Cook to a good scald, and when cold freeze. Can be made any color
desired.

[Illustration: VICTOR ICE CREAM DISHER

Patented October 6, 1908.

The latest and the best. Bowl and knives are German Silver. Metal
part of handle is brass, nickeled. Knives meet in center of bowl and
remain rigid until thumb lever is pressed, which operates the knives
in opposite directions to surface, making a clean cut and dropping the
cream directly under the bowl, and does not flop it as a single knife
disher will do.

  Sizes:  6, 8, 10, 12, 16 and 20 to quart.
  Price, $1.50 each. By mail, 15 cents extra. ]

[Illustration:

  RAPID
  Ice Cream Disher

All parts made of German Silver. The most practical cone-shape disher.
More than 50,000 in use. It is operated with one hand. Simply grip the
handles together, and the four knives cut the cream loose. Relax grip
and coil spring throws the handles back.

Sizes: 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20 and 30 to a quart.

Price, $1.10 each. By mail, 9 cents extra.

(Note the change in price.)]

[Illustration: THE SUPERIOR DISHER

It is a decided improvement in dishers of this class. Cup is made of
seamless steel, shank of brass with wood handle securely fastened by
screw through the center. Knives are German Silver and end of same
turned over edge of cup; this prevents knife from being pressed out of
position when dishing hard ice cream. This feature alone makes it worth
three of the ordinary style.

Sizes: 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16 and 20 to a quart.

Price, 30 cents each. Six cents extra by mail.]
